Space-huge bc of the warehouse, spacious with the open layout and clean. During the day, plenty of lighting, good AC and tables + cubbies in all the right places. Safety-thicc padding. Layout-one of the few areas in Sac that is dedicated to bouldering and the routes don't feel too crowded, easy to distinguish or have a million pieces of old tape going in every direction. Other than bouldering-their gym section is small, but unlike other spaces, TBF makes its own dedicated gym space, not just a bunch of old equipment thrown in a corner or forced into the business so if you wanted to mess with free weights, pull-ups or a dedicated gym floor then you'll have just enough space to do so. Crowds-Maybe I'm going at the right times, but what crowds? Otherwise, they have cool weekly events. Price-Student rate with no rentals or extras-paid 15$. They have a coffee bar area where you can grab a drink-never checked the prices so can't say muchKids-eh, truly dedicated kids section isn't much, but I'm sure your kids would have a blast, more than I've seen elsewhere Parking-big lot, clean and not surrounded by homeless This place is a no brainer-if not here, then go to Pipeworks", "date": "12/16/2018"}

We had so much fun. My first impression is wow this place is huge.. great for beginners like us.. it's not too high it's 14ft high. Would love to do it and again and we will be back here for more for sure.. great for practice. They have a little gym where u can do cardio or lift weights which is pretty cool and they have a sauna also. I had some latte coffee with almond milk at the bar it was not bad. It's ok taste.. don't think worth the money for me. Kambutcha was good we get to tried those..All in all my ratings is 5 solid. We had fun and will do it again we need to practice our upper strength body which is this place is great for it..great for beginners and intermediate level. There's one side I felt like it's for pro rock climbing.. thanks and the guys that showed us around and showed us the climbing techniques.", "date": "9/10/2018"}

Routes: Nice range of difficulty for everyone and everything is spaced out ensuring climbers of all levels different problems to work on, and pretty much no wait time. The walls are pretty tall but there is a gigantic padding to break your fall. By far the softest ones I've had the pleasure of falling on. They also change the routes every 6 weeks or so, allowing time to finish a problem and also give regulars more routes to work with. Space: IT IS HUGE. They also have a separate gym area with weights, treadmills, squat racks, and also a mini climbing gym. It's cool because apparently there's an app where you can put in which holds you want to work on and the wall of rocks light up a path that helps you get stronger! They also have nice clean restrooms, a SAUNA, and also a shower! Also they also have a coffee shop, and nice beer on tap! While you're climbing you can put your belongings in the cubbies provided or the lockers in the restroom! Staff: they have an amazing staff. We've met Sara the many times we've stopped by who's super nice and welcoming. The other employees are also really helpful and help you with the routes as well. Makes it less intimidating to come in. My boyfriend met Clyde? Who's really helpful and super nice! Membership: we got a membership for 180 (for about 3 months) which is an amazing deal considering there was no initiation fee and it's part of their summer deal. I think the daily pass isn't bad either and the shoe rental is only 5 dollars a day!All in all super cool gym! You get to meet amazingClimbers from all over, some professional ones as well. Super dope, everyone's so nice and it's a great place to grow as a climber!", "date": "7/2/2018"}

So refreshing. The setting Reminds me of my home gym Tennessee Bouldering Authority. The only issue is the down climbing rungs stop high up. Unfortunately previous injuries makes it so I have to down climb not jump down. I can down climb my warm ups but if I want to push myself I cannot down climb harder problems. I am trying to learn how to deal with this issue so my body doesn't hurt after a session because I love this gym. However I wish that TBF would experiment with 2 more down climbing holds especially on steeper walls. Episode 101 of the power company seems to agree as they discuss providing down climbing rungs is very important for athletes health and longevity- link below- \"top 5 ways your gym holds you back\" - powercompanyclimbing.com\u2026If I am lucky... maybe Carlo will be able to post a response with tips/solutions etc!", "date": "12/18/2018"}

Beautiful Walltopia walls, great use of volumes , varied climbing styles, and quite a few quality problems. As a shorter woman who relies more on technique than on brute force, I found that these climbs had lovely flow and a great aesthetic feeling to them. There is of course very powerful climbing, but unlike other gyms it is not *only* very powerful climbing. Furthermore, they set with all height ranges in mind which is a rarity in gyms and so appreciated. And last, they use the color system for grading, which really allows people to push themselves, as well as not feel limited by the type of folks who feel the need to tell you that they climbed V7.
