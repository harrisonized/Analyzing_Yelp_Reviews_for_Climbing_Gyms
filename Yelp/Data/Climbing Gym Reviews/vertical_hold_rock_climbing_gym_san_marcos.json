I want to make rock climbing a part of my weekly work our regimen! My butt got kicked in ways i did not think it would! I love how they have different set ups for different levels of difficulty. This also includes self belay routes, partner belay routes, or free boulder routes which does not have a rope attached to your harness. So you essentially rely on your ability to push past your limits and fears to keep climbing and reaching to top unlesd you try to break your fall on these super soft thick mats, which also wotked out fine when my friend had to use it today. Scared the hell out of both of us but she said it was a super soft landing even from 15 ot 20 ft high lol. Anyways, i highly recommend this place! Great family deal if you have that option for 20$ \u00a0month, otherwise ots 60$ for each individual. Theres even a lil gym to help you build up strength if you need to! This includes rock-like pull up stations for your fingers to help your grip strength for the rock climbing improve! Amazing!", "date": "7/31/2018"}

Also, there were too many non-experts and not enough climbing walls in our little 1/3 of the gym, so it felt very crowded.

When it was owned by Solid Rock I would often take my kids there to climb, and ALL of the areas were available to ALL climbers, so my kids were watching the \"experts\" climb the walls they used to be allowed to climb, thinking that it was not fair. I will not be bringing my family to that gym again. I think it is bad for business to only allow most customers access to a small area of the gym.

The staff is great and very helpful, and apparently tonight was Ladies Night! $10 to climb to your heart's desire plus shoes, harness and chalk! Pretty great deal if you ask me! :)Even though there's not as many walls as the Poway location, they still had a lot to choose from, ranging from beginner to expert. If you really wanted to up the ante, there was a little chart with colored tape, depicting the difficulty of the grips. White being the easiest, Yellow/Red medium, Blue/Green being the hardest. All of the grips on the walls have these bright electric tapes, and you had to scale the wall using those colors only. It was KILLER on my arms, but it was so much fun!There are two areas for Bouldering; there's one near the walls, and one in the 18 years + section. In this section there's some gym equipment, mostly for upper body, back and abs. There's also a tight rope to practice \u00a0your balance on. Even though my arms were DEAD from all the climbing, I managed to climb up and conquer the boulder! Once you reach the top, there's some stairs to make your exit safely.This place is tons of fun, and a great workout! Be sure to bring a friend, because it's a two man job; while you're climbing you need someone to belay and pick up the slack in the rope!

The staff were nice enough (one suggested that I check out Nomad Ventures to buy shoes which was a great call) but the facility seems to be there more to make money on birthday parties than for serious climbers.While I am only bouldering at the moment I would prefer to use an ATC instead of a GriGri for belaying. I can understand why those are in place though since the gym is crawling with kids and/or boy scouts many weekends. Luckily I can go back in the top-out boulder area which is generally less busy (except on College nights on Thursdays). That being said the routes seem fine to be as a novice, I'm still only able to climb up to a V1 (or maybe a *very* easy V2 on a good day).I think my biggest beef is that there is not much training equipment specifically for climbing. Sure there are free weights and a campus board but I would have expected at least a fingerboard as well. When I asked about that one staff member told me they used to have one but took it down, and in fact they were going to toss it so he took it home instead. This is a major failure compared to Vertical Hold (which has a stadium board and fingerboard); VH lacks free weight but that doesn't matter to me in the slightest.I bought a 6-month membership here only because it is less travel for me. While I work in Miramar very close to VH I take the Coaster so I don't have a car to get to the gym. If it were closer to home I would gladly pay a little more to join VH but the difference in distance would kill me on gas money so I am just going to continue bouldering in San Marcos for now.

One of the boys suggested rock climbing so we called around and found Solid Rock Gym. Turns out that in addition to having fun and challenging climbing walls, they offer a program where we can rock climb AND earn the Climbing merit badge. The icing on the cake was that that they provide the BSA registered merit badge counselor.The merit badge took two separate 2 hour sessions. We scheduled them for early Saturday mornings were there would be less people. The first session was mostly classroom items, but the last 30 mins the boys were able to get in a harness and free climb. The second session was virtually all climbing and passing off the various MB requirements.Overall the staff was very friendly (they let us plug in our own iPods), knowledgeable and the gym had plenty of ropes and courses for us to climb on. Since we were there Saturday mornings we practically had the place to ourselves.The price for the 2 sessions wan't too bad and included all of the gear (including climbing shoes on the second day) as well as instruction time from the 2 instructors.After each session, I asked our boys how they liked it and each one responded more than enthusiastically. Getting positive vocal responses from teen-aged boys is often hard to do, so well done Solid Rock Gym.", "date": "12/14/2012"}

Im very grateful I found these guys. They are in the process of expanding and will be done in a couple months! Seems like they will double+ their size. After exploring a good amount of indoor spots. I have to say that this gym is high up on my list. Chill tunes, great vibes, and fun scaling routes along the top rope set ups. vladimir was a great help and was super nice. Anytime I'm in the area I will be back for some peace of mind and a nice climbing session.", "date": "9/21/2011"}

We were there for a birthday party today and were supposed to have the party room and be there from 2-5 pm. The mother of the birthday girl was told that we could get there an hour earlier to set up the birthday party. When they arrived there was someone else in the party room and we were unable to put our personal belongings, food, and even our purses anywhere. The previous bday party went over their allotted time and when we were finally able to get into the party room, we were given only 25(ish) minutes to eat, open presents and eat the cake. The manager came in and told us to \"wrap it up\" because there was a birthday party after ours. When we explained that our entire time had been cut by almost an hour and that they were being unreasonable, the manager got very huffy, copped an attitude and began to raise his voice. I have NEVER encountered such a rude and inconsiderate manager in my life. With all of the screw ups, the birthday girl's mom was still made to pay 180.00 and no indication that they wanted to make things better. I hope people see this and think twice about taking their kids there for a birthday party. You will be made to pay and not actually get what you are paying for.", "date": "2/4/2012"}

This is a small gym. It looks like the one in Poway is much larger, maybe more modern but I haven't been to that one. Having said that I LOVED my adventure here. I did not have any previous rock climbing experience at all prior to coming here. (I am in fact afraid of hights) We called before heading over on Saturday and the person on the phone was very helpful and offered all the information we would need, even letting us know that coming before 1 pm that day would be best as they had some birthday parties booked for the afternoon. When we arrived the girl at the desk was great! I can not praise her enough and i wish I remembered her name for this review. We had TONS of fun and felt the effects for days on our muscles! Even though it's small it was great, especially for someone like me who was a slow and inexperienced climber. There were parents teaching their kids and families and lots of beginners to make you feel at home. And for $10 (Summer special day pass) + $5 for gear (we took them up on the shoes included offer but not helmets) it was totally worth the experience!", "date": "6/19/2013"}
