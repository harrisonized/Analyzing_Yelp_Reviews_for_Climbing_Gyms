I am a member here, and although I don't rock climbing I go to their yoga classes 4-5 times a week. A few years ago I started doing yoga at Crunch fitness in San Marcos, and fell in love. I was seeking more challenging and frequent classes. I joined a studio, but it became unaffordable. A good friend and yogi told me 'you should never have to pay that much for Yoga.' Vital makes Yoga affordable, offers classes started at 6:30am, throughout the day, and the last class ending close to 9pm. The quality of classes are amazing. The sense of community is great. The staff is friendly. They offer workshops feee to members on a regular basis. I have had nothing but positive experiences at Vital Oceanside, and even commute up from Encinitas.I hope they expand the yoga program, because the classes are becoming crowded, but have good faith in the innovative staff in finding solutions.", "date": "12/14/2017"}

My friend and I waited near the other students and instructor for the noon class to begin. Not once did Daisy greet us, look at us/make eye contact with us, nothing. The class began and my friend and I still had no clue as for where to stand, what to do, or even knew what was even going on. We did not feel welcomed at all as the rest of the class and the instructor seemed to have known each other very well. All I expected at the very least was to be acknowledged as a \"human being.\" There was no way I could stay where I didn't feel welcome so I asked the two men at the front if we could get our money back and shared my experience with them.

ROGUE weights, that's world class and I'm not sure all these gumbies know what they have at their disposal. Without going into my climbing career I decided to come back for cross training and the whole 24hour access for members was really intriguing. The showers are a little weird as they are shared bathrooms, but aside from being a little dusty(dirty) this happens with climbing gym chalk dust/dirty (my old Solid Rock Days). I use this as my workout place when I'm not working out at my office, it's not close, so it's not used for my daily stuff, just convenience use. It's modern with yoga, some light fitness equipment, couches, food, merch for sale and a nifty cool water fountain. They have some nice easy stuff, some steep stuff, but could use a more clear designation/rating system and a traverse. Plenty of hang boards, bars, grip training devices. The matt is nice, not too firm in the way Spot's are. There are some higher bouldering areas, but no slab. You can see they have multiple setters based on styles, I'm slowly learning them, but I'm still re-beginning my journey while I take breaks from lifting in the corner. It's a bit of a early 20 something hangout and a lot of people just lounge here after climbing. You can plug in your music, but suggest Bluetooth as somehow climbing has become about the individual and less about the community to get you to the top and that's a shame in a way.Like most gym's you can spot the people who climb outside.

That in itself merits a decent review ;)Great corner-most, downtown location. My first visit was on a drizzly Friday afternoon, even with the weather, their large [storefront-like] windows were wide open, allowing for a fresh feel throughout the gym. A spacious gym with lots of climbing routes varying in levels of difficulty. Upstairs they've got equipment, a studio for classes (yoga primarily, I'm assuming), couches and \u00a0a chess/checkers board that I took full advantage of (checkmate!). Downstairs, aside from the climbing area, more equipment is housed in a training corner. If you're going to come to boulder (and you pay for the all-day pass) might as well get in some burpees, squats, arm curls, and Turkish get-ups with a kettle bell -just saying.$2 shoe rental. (Myriad of other products for purchase, of course...) The shoes are walled and ready for you to pull out yourself. The only thing between your feet and the person who wore the shoes before you's feet are fabric softening sheets. Kinda weird, but not a deterrent. Like other climbing gyms I've been to, this one certainly follows suit with the sort of \"chill-spot\" vibe. Couches everywhere, loungey-kitchen area, woodsy feel meets modern design. Where one star is lost is the weird sort of environment created by the climbers. Maybe it's due to being located adjacent to beer on tap, perhaps it's just the downtown hipsters, but I didn't like how so many people sit AND lie down on the mat watching others climb. I felt totally judged! I'm not the best climber, I'm not the worst, but avert your eyes! And they all seemed so comfortable, like frequent climbers with their chalk bags and such, that I approached feelings of intimidation and apprehension watching them watching me (and the friend that accompanied me). I also had my 6 year old son and 1 year old daughter with me and the aforementioned gym-goers seemed so bothered by the presence of my kiddos, whom I was vigilantly trying to keep out of people's climb space!I will very likely come back though! I still had tons of fun, as did my spawns. The people will come and go. I'd like to visit again on a day and at a time when fewer people are there.", "date": "2/24/2017"}

I started out at their Carlsbad location, tagging along with my husband who recently got into climbing and generally feeling super intimidated by the sport as a whole. One of the first things I noticed was the friendly attitude most climbers seem to carry naturally. Most everyone is willing to give pointers where welcome, offering their own tips and perspective on the problem you may be working on, allowing you to see it a little differently.All of the Crew members are equally as awesome. Friendly, happy to help and answer any questions, quick to respond to requests, knowledgeable and overall super approachable. The location itself is pretty large, especially compared to Carlsbad. With wood paneled walls, concrete floors and industrial-type details, it's beautifully designed. Upstairs there are some stationary bikes, rowing machines, a lounge and a bookcase for those who only come to accompany their climbers to enjoy, and a small yoga room with a sliding barn-style door that stays closed during classes (6:30am, 6:30pm and 7:45pm M-F). Downstairs there is some more equipment and a weights station where they hold the Climb Fit class. Vital is dog-friendly, so bring your pooch (as long as he/she is social and comfortable with other dogs and friendly climbers). Kids are allowed, too, but anyone 12 and under needs to be accompanied/spotted by an adult at all times, and kept off of the exercise equipment, which is for adults only. Climbing is fun for the entire family!Obviously, the actual climbing is the best part. The routes change frequently, so you're always finding new climbs to challenge yourself with. Mostly everyone is courteous and there is a great community feel amongst the climbers, beginners and experts alike. I am so stoked that Vital moved into Oceanside, and love getting here a least a few times a week. Do yourself a favor and give it a try - a day pass is $15 and the shoe rental will cost you $2 extra, and after one visit you may find yourself scraping your pennies together for a membership, because it's SO fun and so worth it!

The light and the air in the gym are great. Everything feels so open. Prices are reasonable and the bathrooms/changing rooms were really nice. Routes were interesting, although there was a limited number of challenging options. Take all this with a grain of salt - it was one visit in April 2017.

It's a great place, great instructors who have great attitudes yet are serious when teaching the kids techniques and working out.

My son rock climbs here, The only reason I sound like this is because, as kids, my brother and I did \"parcour\" before it was EVER called parcour. I mean we lived on acres of country land and we climbed trees, ran on (real) rock walls, got the wind knocked out of us on real rocks and when climbing from tree to tree if a limb snapped, oh well, we started swimming if it was over the pond or we stood still while our siblings laughed at us because we could only make 1 sound while being scared to death of not breathing out. The whole idea seems pansy to me, BUT Vital Gym is awesome. Adam the serious one is really quite funny and Parker ( who I nicknamed Parker...hot Parker) is the friendliest easiest going man bun bearing young adult ever!!! (btw, I am not allowed to say Parker...hot Parker in person or my son will disown me...lol) There are a few benefits to turning 52, no one takes you seriously or at the very least dont worry about you hitting on them.

I'm new to climbing, but I have had so much fun at this gym. It has a very communal feel and everyone is super friendly. In addition to bouldering, the gym has free weights, slack line, a couple spin bikes, and free yoga classes. And it's open 24-7 to members! I definitely recommend this place to people of all ages.", "date": "6/2/2017"}

I had meant to cancel my membership and was one day off rather than deal with the hassle I just paid the $60 over emailing the manager like the staff member I spoke to on the phone had mentioned and then followed the steps to cancel online or so I thought.. When I was charged another $60 the following month after I had already canceled or so I thought( Did not still have email to prove). I reached out to the manager who was completely unreasonable. I had paid $180 in total to go ONE time.. This is not counting the two previous times that I had dropped in before becoming a member and brought a large group of people with me. Even after I had explained my situation I was responded to very corporate rather than situational based.. Apparently $60 is worth more to them than having a happy customer.I will no longer be recommending this gym to my friends nor will the ones that I referred \u00a0be coming back.. too bad! ..", "date": "5/16/2017"}

My husband and I drove by this place the other day and the next weekend we checked it out. Wasn't at all what I thought I was getting myself into. So much fun!!!!! We did the day pass: $15/ per person and you can leave and come back all day. The walls are marked by difficulty levels so you know which ones to try. Very easy to navigate. It got pretty busy when we went so we did have to wait to climb some walls, but it was fun watching others and seeing how they got up to the top. The place was clean and very open. They have areas the rest and hangout when you get tired, believe me you will. They offer yoga and 24 hour access if you're a member. I think they offer other stuff, but again I'm not 100% sure. The staff was friendly and helpful. Bring chalk, we didn't know so after a while your hands get Raw. You will wake up hurting the next day, but you'll feel like you just did a great work out. All in all we will be back and it's sparked a liking and interest to climb in me!!", "date": "11/8/2016"}

I went to a 6:30 yoga class and ended up driving around the block six times before I could find a parking place. The issue is not with the gym, but Bagby beer across the street. \u00a0Not only do they have their own parking lot (which at that time of the day, was full) but their patrons park on all of the side streets. \u00a0Maybe it's better earlier or later, but at that time, it's a nightmare. \u00a0The other issue is the class itself. \u00a0I took one of the warm classes, and even though it was a good class, the room they have it in is not designed for heated classes. There is no air circulation, and the class was packed, so by the end of the class, the humidity level was very high and everything in the room was damp, including the floor. \u00a0I almost slipped and fell while walking towards the door in bare feet. (I don't think the flooring in there will hold up to constantly having that much moisture on an ongoing basis) I enjoy Vital gym, but cancelled my membership because of this. I may re-join if they build a bigger yoga studio to accommodate the large crowd it attracts.", "date": "7/1/2017"}
