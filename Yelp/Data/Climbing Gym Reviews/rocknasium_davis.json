Brady also checked up on us as well throughout the day to make sure all was well.There's a good amount of wall space for you to explore on. I will say I feel their bouldering height limit on the wall seems a bit short, but then their floors didn't seem super cushioned to safely catch you if you went up any higher. I will say my friend had a problem with the height of the walls. He's over 6ft, so he literally got up the wall in about 5 strokes.

Which would be fine, but in addition to covering most of the easy walls, the kids were using the only overhung bouldering section to practice rappelling. I started warming up on a v0 there and was halfway up when the girl running the camp was like, excuse me, xxxx is about to rappel, as if I was being rude (not true, he was waiting for her to set up first so he could rappel. They could have waiting the extra 60 seconds for me to finish the boulder at the very least).This continued every 2 minutes or so so the wall was pretty much useless. I got my daypass refunded and on the plus side the staff were pretty cool and nice about it, WHEN they showed up. However, they are clearly understaffed to deal with walk-ins during the day, so it took like 20 minutes for the desk guy to finish his belay class and help me out. During that time, 3 dudes showed up to climb, waited, and then gave up and left lol. I guess they don't need the revenue but seriously if you can't hire enough staff to handle visitors or keep wallspace open, dont say you're open to the public, it's kind of a rip-off to charge people the 15 dollars to climb on the one open (vertical) bouldering wall...", "date": "7/31/2015"}

Honestly, I walked in told the person at the counter that I was looking for a new gym and if it would be okay for me to wander around and talk to other climbers. She did one better and said if I had my climbing shoes I could jump on the wall...WOW! Super friendly...and it's not just the staff, the climbers there are also very friendly and laid back.I resolved to start climbing here at the beginning of December (2011) and haven't regreted it at all. The bouldering area is a great mix of easy to very challenging (gotta love overhangs). The circuits are great too! As for TR and lead climbing, \"yes\" the rating system is different (but climbing is climbing and as another yelper pointed out; the YDS can be subjective), and \"yes\" the routes aren't as tall as another gym, but it's still challenging and you can always do laps.Another great feature is that the staff is willing to belay you if you don't have a partner, so you're not just relegated to the bouldering area.Oh!

It is smaller than some of the more recent gyms to crop up in the area, so some boulder problems will cross the lead and top-rope areas to make the best use of space. At some places this would be a huge drawback, but you will not find as large a population of friendly, helpful climbers as you will here. The regulars here will be happy to hold off while you start your climb, and I've never felt uncomfortable asking the person working the same problem as me for a little beta.BBQs most Tuesday nights, an awesome series of comps near the end of the year, and as family-friendly as you're going to get in town: the place can't be beat!", "date": "7/2/2011"}

Once we had the gear on, we went right into our belay safety class with Boz. \u00a0With the enthusiastic greeter observing the class (made up of just my friend and me), Boz provided clear and concise demonstrations on the basics. \u00a0I was impressed that he even remembered and used our names, as he helped us out. \u00a0Before we knew it, we were ready to go. \u00a0Despite climbing for only about two hours, I had a great time and definitely got a workout out of it. \u00a0The only things that I would be nit-picky about is the slight difficulty of finding the place, and how it would've been awesome if it were more spacious with more walls. \u00a0Like I said, that's only me being nit-picky and it actually isn't that big of a deal overall. \u00a0With the staff making us feel comfortable being in a new environment, providing personal assistance, and consistently making sure we were doing fine even after the safety class, the minor cons are overridden. \u00a0That is why I ultimately rate Rocknasium five stars.", "date": "1/10/2013"}

But maybe it was our instructor, it was her first time teaching it - but I would still say 10 dollars is a little too much for the amount of information offered.I've taken the rock climbing class at the ARC and these walls are more challenging mainly because there are more walls. They have a room specifically for bouldering and it looked like a tiny cave, which was pretty awesome. There are slanted walls for beginners ( I bouldered across these walls simply by walking across, it was funny).And of course they have more advanced routes, there was one that looked like an archway covered with climbing points, it looked tough to climb. $12 all day entrance$3 for shoes, $3 for harness$1 for chalk bag-The people behind the counter were very nice and friendly-Plenty of different walls for a lot of people, and for people of varying skill level-Fun & good exercise!Overall 4 stars (only because of the 10$ belaying lesson, and the fact that the ARC offers rock climbing)", "date": "5/28/2008"}
