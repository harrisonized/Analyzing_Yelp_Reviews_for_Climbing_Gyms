I can't look down when I'm on a single story home or going up escalators. Going wall climbing wasn't my idea and I went in with the intention of climbing 5 feet. My fear of heights stems from not being able to help myself if I fall. We paid $30 for a full day (you can leave and come back), shoes, and Dorian was kind enough to do a rundown on safety with me. Learning everything with Dorian was a good way for me to relax... and stall from climbing the wall. I learned how to tie an appropriate knot by strangling an alien and poking him in the eye! Dorian showed me how to hold the rope when Taylor is scaling the tricky walls and how to catch him when he releases. After some more stalling it was my turn. I had the shakes and that moment of, \"where's the exit?\". I however felt confident from my training with Dorian and knowing Taylor had the rope. I failed hard core and was like a drunk monkey my first climb. After a few more tries I started grasping it more. Literally. I was able to touch the top several times!! I still couldn't look down without freezing but I was getting comfortable with letting go and not worrying about slipping. I appreciated coming to this climbing gym for my first time because everyone was so nice! Thank you Dorian for making me feel comfortable and letting me stall. I definitely will be back to explore more!!", "date": "6/25/2016"}

This included the all the gear, shoes and harness. They also provide you with powder for your hands to keep moisture down.Our trainer was awesome! He took us to the side and he taught us how to figure 8 knot several times. He showed us proper technique and how to act as a belay trust me you don't want to use a auto belay I learned the hard way. After the lesson he took us to he wall for a trial run. We did it once with a belay and then once with auto belay. Word of caution make sure to lean back when descending and feet against the wall. I unfortunately didn't do so the first run and hit the wall. When doing the auto belay DO NOT GRAB THE STRAP when coming down just lean back and let go. We then moved onto bouldering and he showed us the numbering system for difficulty level of the walls. We had so much fun after we got the hang of things. They also offer yoga classes and a small workout section. The staff is great! Super friendly and helpful. They have a full bathroom with lockers and showers.

My visit to the Vertical Hold Rock Gym was my first time trying out indoor rock climbing and I must say that I really enjoyed myself. My friend had purchased a groupon for one quick lesson and day pass for some indoor climbing at this gym in Miramar. She invited me to go because she knew I wasn't scared of heights at all, unlike her. When we first visited we were greeted by the young woman behind the counter who ended up being our instructor as well. The gym provided loaner shoes and harness for each of us. After teaching us how to cinch up the ropes correctly, she let us loose to try out any of their many walls. Rock climbing is definitely way harder than it looks and this gym provides walls that are easy to scale along with super intimidating courses as well. The gym is correctly maintained, clean and organized allowing people to freely flow from wall to the next. Vertical Hold.

From filling out the paperwork to making sure I had all the right equipment, even that was a delightful experience. (By the way, they have student discounts, so take advantage of that.) The locker room is small and simple. There are limited showers (well just one) and bathroom stalls, and the lockers are tiny so leave most of your belongings in the car. I don't understand why the entire floor (especially the top rope area) is covered with pebbles instead of soft mats. Oh but I do think it's cool that they are starting to install auto-belayers, which is super high tech. There is a middle bouldering area where you have to drag the crash pads whenever you climb to make sure you don't fall on said ridiculous pebbles.My favorite place to boulder is the upstairs \"cave\" which also has a small yoga area. The routes are super challenging here, even the most basic ones. Seriously if you can climb here, you can climb at a lot of other gyms that normally have easier routes. Huge semi-unrelated plus is that there are many breweries close by to grab a beer with friends after climbing together. The ultimate bonding experiences.", "date": "2/4/2015"}

The staff was really friendly. They taught me all of the safety precautions, signals for communicating between climber and belayer, tying knots, and looping and tightening the rope. He also made sure me and my roomie were comfortable with everything and watched each of us climb and belay once to make sure we were confident to go on our own. I felt comfortable after then to climb them rocks! You can ask for a bag of chalk and clip it to your belt. The chalk helps with your grip on the rocks while climbing and also on the rope while belaying.

They are shredded like extras from the movie 300. \u00a0When I finished only 3 climbs I was sore in muscles that I don't think I had ever used. As a first timer and someone who is afraid of heights I was pretty nervous during my belay lesson. So much that I kept screwing up the knots I needed to master before they let me climb. Thankfully the instructor was patient and basically held my hand through it step by step until I felt comfortable enough on my own. Once I passed the knot and belay test I was free to explore the little city of manmade walls that waited. It's massive and kept in very good shape despite being one of the oldest in the area. To put into perspective how large it is Solid Rock's 3 locations aren't as big as it so expect to be mesmerized. \u00a0Big ups to my buddy Dave for introducing me to this place and the sport of rock-climbing.

After booking tickets to head down to San Diego, my friends picked me up and asked if I would like to climb. Being a fan of bouldering, I nonchalantly said, \"Yes\" (after all, I am still heartbroken). When they were driving me through what seemed endless miles of furniture stores, we arrived at a building that was away from the main streets and unassuming to the untrained eye. We had arrived at Vertical Hold and I wasn't ready for the awesome that lay inside.APPEARANCE: 5 starsFrom the moment you walk in, you can tell this place has got it together. Firstly, the place is fantastically huge. With very high ceilings to accommodate very high rock climbing, the place is filled with mucho amounts of climbing. To give you perspective, it is:- 3x the size of Rock City- 2x the size of Rockreation- 5x the size of ClimbxHuge. Also, the place is immaculately clean. Most climbing gyms are filled with an air of chalk, B.O, and feet. Not this place. Because they have such large, open space available, and their venting is fantastic, the place smells fresh and alive.Also, the floors and walls are clean. Aside from the chalk residue on rock handles, the walls themselves are very well kept and clean. The floors around the walls are filled with small rocks, almost like a sea of pebbles to cushion your feet. The work station where they take your money and rent out equipment is also very clean, with equipment placed in designated spaces and areas. Honestly, I cannot believe how well organized they are. It shines in everything they do and it's hard not to be impressed by the cleanliness of this place.CLIMBING: 5 starsThe climbing here is fantastic. All the holds feel solid and the paths are well placed and distinguished. The ratings seem fit to the paths (for the most part), and there is so much space in this climbing gym you don't have to worry about waiting to climb. To have so much freedom and options available for you is absolutely liberating for a climber.PRICE: 4 starsThe price for a regular day pass is $15, while harness rental is $5. However, depending on the day you are there, there is always specials going on so you really have to see. Student discounts are given as well so just inquire.CONCLUSIONI've been to several rock climbing gyms in my area, and only left one where I felt impressed. Now that I've been to Vertical Hold, I can say that I have a new climbing gym to put as the creme de le creme. With a friendly staff, friendly climbers, and a gym that won't kill your senses, Vertical Hold has definitely won me over as a new favorite. It'll also be a great excuse to come back down to San Diego again.", "date": "3/27/2012"}

That went a long way to making us feel better about recommending Vertical Hold again. But definitely read through the membership agreement really carefully when you sign up.---This is a really great local gym. We've been going for almost two years now and have had a membership for about half of that. The staff is really cool and the routes are solid.Unfortunately... we've had sort of a bad experience here, which has soured our feeling for the gym. We wanted to suspend our membership because we'll be out of the country, but apparently if you're gone for more than 3 months, you have to cancel it. I was pretty surprised; we had to suspend for short stints before and never ran into that problem.So we fill out the paperwork to cancel, and it turns out that there's a \"60 day notice\" clause. So now we have to pay an extra $200 in membership fees, because we were (1) loyal members who (2) didn't remember a contract we signed over a year ago.We go in all the time and are constantly dragging other people over to the gym. Once we rolled in with 10 new folks who'd never been before. What I'm trying to say is, we were really loyal customers who tried to spread the word about a cool local business. And somehow, we ended up burned! One of the staff said it happens all the time, which means that they're squeezing a bit of extra cash out of loyal customers who have to leave.If nothing else, let this be a \"cautionary tale\" for others with memberships: make sure to give them tons of notice if you need to cancel, move, whatever.I don't blame the staff, their hands are tied. But it's really soured my feeling about the business, and I don't think we'll be coming back when we return to San Diego. Looks like it'll be Mesa Rim next time around.", "date": "7/10/2013"}

Way more so than some of the others nearby. Definitely my home gym forever.", "date": "3/31/2016"}

There are hair ties and tampons in the ladies locker room which I think is a super nice touch. It is $16.00 for a day pass - If you go between 10am and 3pm the \"Lunch Pass\" is a steal... only $10 to climb! Almost every day of the week there is a different special... Fridays is Ladies Night so it is $12.00 for a day pass instead of 16. (Mondays $4 off for students, Wed $4 off for guys, Sundays Military $9 off) On Tuesday and Thursday evenings there is free yoga from 8p-9p. There are membership options which are a bit pricey but I guess could be worth it if you go often enough. You can rent gear (harness, shoes, and chalk) for $6.00 but if you enjoy the sport I highly encourage you to invest in your own gear. It is a lot more comfortable (and cleaner!)", "date": "6/6/2013"}

I climb V3/V4s at most gyms and I was only climbing a V1 here (tried a V2 but didn't quite make it to the topout). Make sure you give yourself time to rest in between climbs because you will tire out otherwise. Top roping was fun because you use ATC's and not auto belay or grigri's which is more intimate and also nicer for when you want to come down quickly. \u00a0You do have to get certified by a member here and I think the classes to learn how to belay are $9 a person if you are new to it.

Like other reviews have mentioned, this place is clean. All the gear is well taken care of (shoes didnt have any gross odors or stains), the walls are changed frequently, and the bathrooms and facilities are immaculate.Our trainer was Paul, who was very personable and helpful in getting my wife comfortable with knot tying and belay technique. The intro took longer than I expected, which was actually nice considering that they value safety, and your confidence, as opposed to just sending you off onto the wall without supervision. All in all I plan to go back very soon to get my finger strength up, and eventually work my way outside to the real deal. If your thinking of giving climbing a try, Vertical Hold is a great place to get a feel for the sport in a very safe and comfortable environment. HIGHLY RECOMENDED!", "date": "4/19/2012"}

They also have a bouldering cave on the second floor with a soft floor to land on.

Since he was about to start school, I suggested we go use it. The place is located in an industrial area, kinda hard to find at first since it's tucked away at the back end of the driveway. We walked in and basically signed our lives away. Haha. The only other time that we've rock climbed was years ago on a cruise ship. We had to get a belaying lesson, but our teacher was running late so the girl at the front told us to just free climb on the boulder in the meantime and he'll come and get us when he was ready. The boulder is huge and takes up the middle of the gym. People just climb up this thing with no harness or anything. We tried to find a route to climb up around the whole thing, but it was hard and scary. \u00a0The gym is lined with padding on the floors along most of the walls in case you do fall, but I didn't really want to test it.We finally found a part of the wall with a route we thought we could do. My bf went first and he made it. I tried next and made the mistake of looking down while almost at the top and freaked myself out so I came back down. I tried again and ended up doing it, but my heart was definitely racing. I'm terrified of heights and especially since we didn't have harnesses yet, I give myself a pat on the back for conquering that.The belaying lesson was very helpful. The guy taught us how to tie the proper knots and how to belay with safety in mind. Afterwards, he watched us belay on each other and then gave us the okay to do it on our own. My boyfriend and I tried every route we thought we could do. It was an amazing adrenaline rush and a good workout. I just had to make sure that I didn't look down at any point during my climb. By the end of it, our hands were red and couldn't hold anymore and our muscles were fatigued. It was a great experience (perhaps, even trust building exercise) and wasn't too expensive either.

For others, your experience might not be the same as mine.I only did boldering, so i can't fully review how the rock climbing part is. The only thing I can say about the rock climbing is that they had lots of walls to rock climb in, but that is normal for a climbing center like this one.Parts of the center did not have enough lighting, so it got tough to see some of the areas and the 'rocks' on the wall to grab. They do have a sideways boldering wall, which was a first I've seen from others I've been to, so that was cool.Their rental shoes smelled really bad, but that's what you get for renting shoes from places. They could have somehow freshened them up better because after each bolder climb, you have to traverse down a ladder and I could smell the stench coming from the shoes.Lastly, with boldering, the VFun routes are pretty challenging. i am about a V1-low V2 at this place because i did a few of their V1 routes, but for the other 2 friends i came with, they struggled with the VFun routes. I would think the VFun routes would be super easy, but they were a challenge, so careful!

I have not really been rock climbing a bunch so I don't have a lot to compare to. The staff was nice, and this place seemed a lot more intense and \"hard core\" then the other places I have rock climbed. Every wall had a rope with a figure 8 knot that you had to tie to your harness. Other places just had a clip which required no effort at all. This fucked up your hands a little more, but it was kind of a cool experience. Their belaying mechanism also was a lot more intense. Other places have the automatic locking belayers, but this place you had to do it all yourself and make sure to have a firm grasp on the rope at all times or else your partner would be dropped to their DOOM. We went with a military guy and they gave us all the Sunday military deal. It was inexpensive enough and 15 dollars included the day pass, shoes, and the harness. He also showed us how to do the figure 8 knot for free, although it is kind of annoying that they would have charged us for a lesson if we hadn't been before. I would think first time people would be treated better or have a more inexpensive experience in order to convince them to come back. (logically...) It was fun! There was lotion and tampons in the bathroom, but the boys bathroom did not have any lotion, so we grabbed some extra for them. Did not really make sense, but oh well!Side Note: This place acts all environmentally friendly and stuff, but then their water jug thing has a note that says \"Our cups are not recyclable, please bring a water bottle.\" Why.... don't you buy recyclable cups instead of bitching about how people who have been climbing around for hours and are thirsty are killing the earth with the cups you chose to purchase?

I had booked a 5pm Saturday group party for my boyfriend's 25th Birthday. Since it's the big quarter century birthday I was looking to do something different sans party bus, alcohol or bottle service. These were my goals:- Gather our closest friends and pay the tab for the whole activity, meaning something reasonably priced.- Be able to bring our own food, drinks and of course birthday cake. - Do something that most of us haven't done before.- A place where my friends can bring their kids if they decide to take them. They have kids walls and they we're cool about my friend bringing her 4-month old, don't worry the baby didn't rock climb :)So thanks again to my lover Yelp, I found Vertical Hold.If you can gather 10 people (minimum for groups) at $20 each you can learn how to tie the proper safety knots, belay and rock climb. You can trade off belay partners and test your friendship cause your trusting that they will not let your ass fall and get gravel up your woohaa. You can yell at each other to \"Man up!\" even though you're not a man. You can chant your friend's last names as they climb up. You can take super cool pictures. In all seriouseness, they do care about your safety so during the safety lesson they really do make sure you know your stuff. Make sure you pay attention and don't get ahead of yourself. They'll make you practice your double-eight knots and proper belay technique. They don't make you feel dumb when you do it wrong (haha my first-time belaying was dangerous!). They also have an upstairs area where you can eat and sit and still enjoy a 360 degree view of the gym and take cool pictures from the higher angle. It was super fun and our whole group can't stop talking about the experience. The guys at the front were nice and patient with our group even though we have attention spans of 4-year olds when we're all together. They have a 10:30am/1pm/5pm time slot for groups I recommend the 5pm time. no one told us this but MAKE SURE YOU STRETCH OUT! My sore ass body says \"Thanks Vertical Hold!\"", "date": "8/23/2010"}

We had a great time, and there are routes for every skill level. One note, bring some socks, because the rental shoes smell horrendous. Kudos for having courtesy deodorant, Lysol, and lotion in the men's locker room though. You're gonna need it afterwords.. Also, a great place to take a date, the view can be really nice...", "date": "11/2/2010"}

They do have good deals on certain days for students but its still more expensive than Solid Rocks Gyms day passes and college nights but neither have the same quality of climbing as Mesa Rim but their prices are way higher...Vertical Hold wouldn't be my first choice to climb but i do like it, it has great people and definitely a fun place to bring friends.

Getting set up at the front desk was pretty easy, it was $6 for a harness and shoes and you sign a liability wavier and your off. I was with two experienced climbers so no belay lesson needed which allowed us to get right into our climbs. There a a great variety of walls to scale and they are marked very well with different color tags to let you know which routes are more difficult.

I am pretty sure one goes by Gemini and the other was named something like Nitro. They wear tight 80's-style spandex and their hair is longer than most girls I know. Anyway, once I start up the wall, they wait about 7 seconds and then start climbing--right underneath me!At first I thought this a bit strange, but nevertheless continued on my steady climb upwards. Surely they would not try to overtake me mid-climb! Oddly enough, both Nitro and Gemini would then start grabbing for my ankles in an attempt to throw me off the wall! I would shake them off once or twice, but then usually I would succumb to their shenanigans. I would be pulled off the wall and after gliding back down to the ground, Nitro and Gemini would then engage in some sort of celebratory dance/chest bump. It was all very humiliating for me.However, it is not all bad news with those two. I will forever remember the one time they once again waited for me to get about 15 feet up before they began their hunt, for lack of a better word. This time, though, I shook Gemini hard enough with my leg that he fell off the wall! I frantically climbed, my muscles aching with every reach. I could sense Nitro was right on my heels. But I pressed on. I just had to get away! So i eventually made it up to the top of the wall. Amazingly, a button had been placed there that I had never seen before. I pushed it.

They have guys night, girls night, members night, military nights, and even a singles night.", "date": "1/31/2009"}

They have their own traversing wall and 2 levels of bouldering. \u00a0Because of their massive amount of space, they are able to have a ton of routes for beginners and intermediates. \u00a0It is a great place if you are just starting out. \u00a0Other gyms I go to, are usually more catered to intermediates and advanced climbers. \u00a0They have friendly staff and are open really late. \u00a0They also have specials on Fridays where ladies get in for $3 off and gentlemen get in on Thursdays for $3 off.The reason that this gym only gets 4 stars is because they do not attach the tags to the hold securely enough. \u00a0Thus the tags fall off by the end of the day and you are struggling to find the complete route. \u00a0Compared to other gyms, this gym is more on the pricey side. \u00a0It's $15 for a day pass, but $10 if you go between 10 am - 3pm on weekdays. \u00a0Also a monthly membership of $50 with a $60 initiation fee. \u00a0Overall, GREAT place to climb!!", "date": "5/6/2009"}

Their hours and policies are similar, but I find their prices significantly cheaper than that of solid rock---I know it is down to $6 off for military (or students now) for admission. \u00a0That is affordable when you have your own harness and shoes. \u00a0And depending on the person, they don't actually check ID, but will just give you the discount arbitrarily if you look broke/student/military. \u00a0Their memberships are only $55 as well, vs. around $90 for solid rock, and they provide better customer service. \u00a0Their routes are not very hard, few 5.10's and fewer 5.13/5.12, several overhangs, bouldering area, and top rope available. \u00a0+ both gyms do offer meet up group discounts for San Diego rock climbers as well (not listed on their website). \u00a0More information such as free yoga classes and ladies night, etc. can be found on their website. Now I am by no means a regular, nor a Chris Sharma, but here is what I have gathered about Vertical Hold vs. the others guys: It is less crowded--- the patronage seems to be a more UCSD esque, serious athlete vibe, rather than a girl scout birthday party. \u00a0There are less screaming children running amok so i can actually get some real climbing done. \u00a0NOTE, I would be willing to shell out the extra bucks for Solid Rock if I did not feel like I was paying to have my climbing experience trumped by out of control monkeys high on sugar. It is more inspiring this way to be around a more serious ambiance. \u00a0I've done the bulk of my overhang training under these conditions. \u00a0So it is in my professional recommendation that if you want to do some more serious training that will get you ready for outdoor climbing, go with this gym. \u00a0If you want to throw a birthday party for your kid, please, stick with Solid Rock and stay out of my way. \u00a0Sidenote* the shirtless eye candy does not hurt either.", "date": "5/9/2010"}

Lots of good routes for all skill levels. Recommend going here for any indoor climbing in San Diego. Not nearly as crowded as Solid Rock, and the caliber of climbers is better.

Then a staff member who wasn't even supposed to start until 1pm saved the day. Got us the remaining equipment, took us through the lesson and totally redeemed the gym in my eyes. Don't remember his name, but he had a cool 'stache and a nice laid-back vibe. By this time, the front desk had gained their cool and all was well.
