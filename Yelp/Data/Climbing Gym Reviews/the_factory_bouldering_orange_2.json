Though Factory Bouldering is not as big as some of the Touchstone Climbing gyms up in northern California (where I have my normal climbing membership), Factory Bouldering has enough problems for one to climb for hours on end. Since the gym isn't super tall, there aren't any problems that you get to top-out on. Not a pro or a con in my mind - just something to note.I met a few people while I was climbing today and everyone here seemed extremely friendly. Nobody was pretentious or lost in their own world with earbuds in, and I even met somebody who shared some beta on a problem I was stuck on.

And they have a section for weekly comp problems which is awesome. The staff is super welcoming and nice and everyone who comes are always super friendly and will hype you up while you climb! I also love how they put a huge effort in building a community within the gym. They do student discount days, monthly potlucks, climbing lessons/clinics, and competitions!

BUT! Fear not beginners!The rocks on the wall are color coordinated and labeled by levels of difficulty. And check the wall post! It'll indicate the levels of difficulty of each color, so you don't have to worry about where to start as a beginner. Heads Up: There aren't any harness to catch you, but the whole area is padded with large crash pads for when you do fall. (And after falling a lot, it's safe to say the pad works GREAT)I like that the staff made you feel welcomed and that you can take your time climbing your section. It also seems like everyone there were all open minded and were supporting and rooting for each other as well. So you can watch and learn from others. Honestly, the more I climbed, I wanted to get better. Needless to say, we'll be back for more blisters! $18/ All day & $4 for shoe rental. It's bit on the pricy side but for all day it's not so bad.

I climb both indoors and outdoors and let'me tell ya finding a place that has good creative problems makes a world of difference in your enjoyment.The problems here are higher in difficulty than most other bouldering gyms in SoCal when comparing route difficulty. They adopted a color system that encompasses a band of v-ratings since different problems may be easier or harder for different individuals depending on your style, height, and power level. \u00a0The frequency of changing out problems is pretty good running about every few weeks for a certain section of the gym. The walls are pretty short so the routes are often completed in 6-10 moves. There are lots of crimps and over hang problems. Less slab problems and some balance \u00a0problems here and there.Dues or day pass are one of the cheapest in SoCal.The overall vibe is pretty friendly but slants more toward the college/young professional demographic.

If you're new, you have to fill out a waiver form, so give yourself some time to get that started. Once you're entered in, you pay the fee.

For a first timer, I stuck with v0 routes and they were difficult as hell! The paths closest to the entrance are much easier than the ones located in the back. As you get used to how to scale the wall with a friend to guide your hand and foot placements, it's a bit easier to get to the top. Gosh, this sounds like a metaphor to life. Anyway, I suggest climbing with a friend and having some chalk powder handy to help with the calluses that will build upon your fragile hands. After a few attempts at climbing (maybe 4-5 v0 routes), my hands were red, sore and tired. You'll definitely need breaks in between :)I feel like the difficulty levels were pretty challenging even for a beginner status at v0 or v1.

Whenever you come in, they always say hi or hello to you and when you leave, they always greet you goodbye. There is a great community here at this specific gym. Everyone knows everyone and you're bound to talk to someone when you're climbing at the gym. There is such a great friendship here. When you're climbing, there's always people rooting you on or asking you how you did a certain move. It's awesome.A day pass, before 2:30pm is $8, and after 2:30, it's $12. Shoe rentals are $3, which isn't bad considering local shoe rentals are $5 and up, and other day passes are$15+. The motto at the gym is \"building better climbers\" and they really stick to it. The routes are a little more difficult than other gyms, but it's great when you climb somewhere else and you're actually a higher grade than at this gym. Confidence booster!The workers are constantly changing the routes here and it's great because you'll never get bored of a wall too quickly. There's always red dots going up (routes are going to be removed) and green dots as well (new routes). This isn't a sticker gym, so you just follow the color of the rock to head to the top.One thing i really like about the gym is that even though you're one level, you could probably try higher grades without feeling disappointed. I've completed some routes that were above my grade level plenty of times. It's just because the rocks are different and the routes are set differently. The different walls make a difference as well. I like that there's a straight wall, a slab wall, but also some caves to work on upper body strength.I'm really glad that they added the extension to the gym. There's more workout machines and equipment for you to get stronger for climbing, hence the motto \"building better climbers\".The Factory always has BBQ nights where you can come, bring some food, and enjoy climbing with a bunch of people. There's also student nights where it's $8 all night long as long as you show a student ID. The music that they play is also always on point. If you're not into a playlist, they'll be more than happy to change it so you can find your groove and climb.Another plus at the Factory is their water fountain. Surprisingly, some climbing gyms don't have one and they force you to buy drinks that are overpriced. not cool.They even have free wifi if your friend are done climbing early or just don't want to climb at all. This gym is really accommodating to their members and the community.", "date": "2/14/2015"}

I asked if we needed to get chalk powder to help or tape. He let me and my friend use some of his since he had already rang us up and the minimum charge was $5 on a credit card.

Other times we asked people for tips and they were happy to show us their tricks. When we got tired and believe me my upper body was killing me... my friend and I went to the ping pong tables and took a break before going back to bouldering. I'm definately going back. If only it was closer to me I would go more often. We probably spent about three hours there on Saturday and it was a great time. I'm going to try and go the weekends unless I find a place I like that's closer to me.", "date": "4/5/2017"}

Eh eh get it? OK OK here we go!Pros:1) Conveniently located near the 57 freeway and in between cities of Orange, Anaheim, and Santa Ana.2) Large and spacious building.3) Large crash pads along the walls and wide enough to keep both the climbers and spectators safe.4) Luxurious and fun lounge area with plenty of benches, bean bags, sofas, ping pong tables, and billiards table. On top of that there are enough tables to study on.5) The members on average are very friendly and helpful. Come with a friendly attitude, because I'm sure you'll make some friends here!6) Weight training area with all equipment needed to build bouldering muscles for your epic climbs. 7) Training walls for specific holds.8) Routes are changed regularly to keep things challenging and to keep you interested.9) Affordable memberships that range between $40-$50 a month or better during specials. 10) Staff are super friendly and helpful.11) Free wifi.12) It beats a regular gym. You'll build a skill and get fit than just learning how to carry heavy stuff and run in place.Cons:1) I have nothing. This is the best gym at the best price around the OC.", "date": "2/11/2017"}

How to improve Factory:1) Change up the problems and courses a bit. They do not change the wall settings very frequently so if you go once a week, chances are you will be climbing the same problems for a little while. 2) The price is actually pretty good compared to Cliffs of ID and other gyms. Lately other gyms have increased their prices but Factory remained the same. So it is a good deal. 3) The holds are a little more rough on the hands then Cliffs of Id or Hollywood Bouldering (I know I know don't be such a priss, develop those climbing hands, ya ya I've heard it).4) Have a changing room.

Pros: -Incredibly friendly and helpful staff that play great music-Routes of all difficulty levels that are changed often and mimic routes that can be found outdoors-New colored grading system (see one of the photos I posted)-Walls of all different angles, caves, and a new roof section-Clean (as clean as a climbing gym can get)-Two ping pong tables and a pool table-Free Wifi-Membership benefits (Free monthly guest pass, two free guest passes on your birthday month, discounts on climbing shoes, etc.) -System wall, campus board/wall, several hang boards, and a balance board-Swole Corner (weights, two olympic racks, bicycle, treadmill, rowing machine, dip bar)-Drinking fountain-Drinks/snacks available for purchase at front desk along with chalk, climbing shoes, crash pads, and Factory swag #repthef-$15 all day pass, $12 day pass for students, $3 shoe rental-Only $8 for a day pass if you go before 2:30 PM (don't know if this is all the time, but it seems it has been the case more often than not when I go)-New student days where students can get in at anytime during the day for $8-BBQ and Bouldering every month-In house recycling-Awesome, chill environment/atmosphereCon:-Not open 24 hours a dayFOR NEW CLIMBERS: Bouldering, and climbing in general, is a difficult sport, so do not expect to come here and breeze through the routes, especially with how stiff the grading of the routes is at the Factory. Expect to come and have a great time, but to also get an intense workout and push yourself to your physical limits. Bring plenty of water, wear thin socks (shoes rentals are available for $3), bring climbing chalk if you have some (can purchase some at the front desk), make sure to stretch (before and after climbing) and most importantly, bring some friends. Hope to see you some new faces at the gym; if you see me there feel free to say hi and climb with me! Overall, I have nothing, but good things to say about The Factory Bouldering; I have been very fortunate to call this place my home gym. TL;DR: Whether you are someone who is new to climbing and is looking to get into the sport, a more experienced climbing and wanting to advance your bouldering, or someone just looking for a great workout and to have an even better time, The Factory Bouldering is the perfect place to go.

The boulder problems here flow well and range from powerful to technical styles of climbing. Speaking of range, the boulder problems are arranged according to a \"circuit system\", which means that the climbs aren't given a specific difficulty level. Instead, they are given a difficulty range (usually 2-3 V-grades). The purpose of this is so that climbers who follow a colored circuit will have the chance to climb boulder problems that are a little more challenging than they are used to, but without psychologically defeating themselves before trying it (i.e. \"I can't do that boulder problem...it's rated \"blah\", and I don't climb that hard.\").", "date": "5/3/2016"}

You're not on a rope, won't find 40' walls to get \"scared\" at the top of; instead it's short climbs that focus on technique and/ or power to navigate. That's not to say you have to be a regular climber to enjoy the place... plenty of first timers, even dates show up, but \u00a0its not something you see a lot of kids birthday parties doing either.For regular climbers:What I really like about this place is the attitude both of the climbers at it (never had so many people willing to provide beta or work through a route) and how the staff approaches the place. Problems are pretty tough compared to other gyms but there's a huge variety of them in the wall design (straight to major cave), the holds (they've got some crazy customs) and the style (crimp to dyno). Given how big it is, they can re-set without removing your favorites pretty often too.Evenings get the typical post-work rush but I find the place flows pretty well even during events and is pretty much all yours during working hours or with just a few others on weekends.Recent changes (as of late 2013): Since my initial visits & review in 2012, The Factory has grown rather significantly nearly doubling the wall space, adding another restroom, and a small set of traditional gym gear (treadmill, rowing machine, bench / multifunction weight machine). There's also a system board [nothing I understand but impressive to see people use] and a number of hangboards / balancing rigs around... making it much more viable as a primary gym.And oh, they have A/C which may not sound like a major deal, but Anaheim in the summer... exactly.", "date": "12/5/2013"}

I can't compare it to anything else as I haven't been to another gym yet, but I've been told how great it is that FB is a bouldering-only gym, not a climbing, with bouldering on the side. I can see how that can be frustrating. It's an absolutely great huge space where you can lounge around in the middle if you need a break (my friend said he's stopped by before to take naps on the couch). The padded mats surrounding the bouldering walls are over a foot thick...maybe even two? That you feel okay about falling. And I've seen pictures where other places use colored tape to mark trails and that shit looks confusing as hell. They used colored holds here, so it's easy to see the trail you need to follow on your way up before and during your climb.Plenty trails for beginners to learn on and enjoy, and everyone I met at the gym has been courteous about sharing the climbing space (but it's big enough where it doesn't ever feel crowded).Have fun!", "date": "12/5/2012"}

I love rock climbing, so I was up for the problem (shoutouts to solving problems).I came at the anniversary day last weekend and so the price tag was reduced. I paid 8 dollars, but I think normally its about 15 dollars. The staff are all really laidback and chill. The actual facility is clean and spacious. You totally don't feel like cramped. I highly suggest anyone and everyone to check this place out. Solving problems from beginning levels to LS aka shenanigans. The mats are super safe so even if you feel weak and can't hold yourself, you have nothing to worry about since the mats are pretty protective. If you are a beginner like myself, I suggest you bring some friends along with yourself so it'll be more fun and more worth your money. PS. This would be an awesome place for dates or group dates. For the family, the kids would have to be big enough or strong enough to hold themselves, but nonetheless I think kids can enjoy themselves if they are well behaved and ready to solve some problems...and not be a problem. : )", "date": "4/21/2014"}

Pretty hard for the grade. There are many routes I like too. My only gripe (and a major one ) is that they have the chalkest, dirtiest , slippery-est holds of any gym I've seen. Many footholds are so covered with chalk you can not even figure out the color of the holds while you're climbing. And handholds and footholds get really slippery because of the amount of chalk and rubber on them. You can brush all the holds but it's gonna take you so much effort that you won't have energy to climb after. Just need to clean the holds more often and would have 4.5 stars IMHO", "date": "1/21/2016"}

I recommend this location to any of my friends and family. They have monthly fun events for both non-members and members to make the climbers feel more welcomed such as their awesome potluck BBQ. The routes periodically change (for a whole rennovation, it's roughly estimating every 2-3 months, and for small route changes such as 6-10 routes, it's roughly every 2-3 weeks) so there will always be new challenging routes. They have deals for non- members such as $3 before 3pm on Wednesdays and $5 off before 5 pm on Fridays. They also have ladies' night which is $7 and this deal usually lands on a Monday of each month. They used to have guests' night where a member can bring in one guest for free, but now they offer one free pass for members to bring in their one guest anytime of the month. Give the place a try if you're interested in bouldering. The couple that owns this establishment are outdoors sport climbers and boulders (Louie Anderson and Valerie Tes Heredia), so the routes are similar to outdoor routes (in my opinion), and they made sure their chosen route setters have a background of climbing outdoors. So if you're interested in climbing outdoors, this is the place to start and train for it :).

All sorts of shapes: roofs, caves, dihedrals, aretes and even slabs. Instead of tape they use holds of the same color, which makes the gym look that much cleaner. I also have no problem following the routes as other reviewers have suggested.Prices are pretty good and they offer many discounts: students, ladies' nights, greek nights.The climbing is STRONG! But unlike most other gyms it isn't frustrating. The climbing is such that you really want to work hard to finish the route. Which makes you a stronger climber. Just one of the ways they stay true to their motto.The owners are lovely people and are there often climbing with the members and making sure everyone is having a good time. They are both really strong climbers too and when i need any beta they are always happy to help. The Factory is big on creating a good hangout for climbers. Also, free pool-table?!?!?!? heck yeah.

The mats/padding are seamless and all built into the floor under the walls at the perimeter of the gym. \u00a0It is essentially one giant mat/pad. \u00a0None of those individual crash pads stuck together or find a crash pad laying around and drag it under the route you're about to climb. \u00a0Once you stand on the matting here, you can tell it is top grade and quality. \u00a0No fear from falling from even the top, as the matting is more than forgiving. \u00a0Safety for climbers was at the forefront for the owners and the money invested in the matting shows it. \u00a0Beginners no longer need to fear falling and injuring themselves like they do at other gyms.The entire space is open and inviting. \u00a0Very clean and organized. \u00a0 Free wifi and a plugin area for laptops as well. \u00a0Restrooms are fantastic and clean as well; automatic soap dispensers and hands free dryer. \u00a0There are so many details and thoughts that you can see that went into the gym.The bouldering problems here are mentally, physically, and technically challenging. \u00a0There are routes for everyone, from beginners to the the advanced. \u00a0Routes are not taped; each route uses holds that are one color, which gives a cleaner, easier, and visually appetizing route. \u00a0There are a few routes designated as VS, with the S standing for shenanigans. \u00a0These are super fun and nuts; one requires you to run at the wall, jump on a few blocks, leap to a giant hold, and then maneuver to the top ledge.Access to the gym is convenient--right off the 57 and Katella.You can tell that the owners, Louie and Valarie, put tons of hardwork, hours, and thoughts into this gym. \u00a0And it is certainly worth it.Louie and Valarie are warm, welcoming, friendly, and personable. \u00a0Them as well as the staff will walk around the gym and engage customers in friendly conservation and advice.Louie has built and helped build other popular rock climbing gyms in the area (Hangar 18, Tru Hold Climbing, etc.) and has been a lifetime sport and indoor climber since a kid. \u00a0So you can be sure that he knows what a great rock climbing gym is and should be.Without hesitation, The Factory Bouldering is worth the visit and membership.", "date": "4/28/2012"}

Something that sets them apart from competitors like Rock City, Hangar 18 and Threshold is that they are a bouldering only gym. That means no top ropes or lead climbing. For some this might be a drag but this also means no endless amounts of children running around for birthday parties. Atmosphere + Staff:The atmosphere is one of fun and dedication and hold their motto \"Building Better Climbers\" close to their hearts. The staff is friendly and engaging and are always helping members with their technique. The owner and his fiance are some of the most amazing people ever, super fun, and are always climbing with the members. Walls + Routes. There are walls of varying degrees of overhang and a rumored boulder with a severe overhang to be installed in the middle of the gym within a year or so. The routes are masterly crafted by setters who have vast experience climbing indoors and outdoors, they know what will get you stronger. The routes range from vB to v12 in all styles and there are over 200 of them, 20% of which are switched out for new routes every 10 days. There is always something new to climb which is extremely important. They also have vS routes (S stands for shenanigans), this routes are super fun and include things like run and jumps, drop downs, campus routes and any other quirky moves the setters can come up with. Amenities:I love the dyson air blades in the bathroom, it's kind of a ridiculous statement but they dry your hands in like 10 seconds. Also the pool table and lounge area is really nice and the charging stations are super convenient. They sell everything you need to climb- shoes, chalk, brushes, chalk bags, food and drink, as well as crash pads for outdoor climbing. Theme Nights:I love that The Factory has special climbing nights every once in awhile. For instance, once a month they do \"Cookies & Climbing\" and everyone brings sweets and climbs together, it's delicious and productive! Also they have a bring a friend for free night for members. A few weeks ago they had Yama Climbing come in and create custom chalk bags and chalk buckets for super affordable prices. I got a chalk bucket and LOVE it. The theme nights are great and I'm sure there will be more to come!Personal Experience:I climbed at Rock City on and off for 5 years and though that gym got me interested in climbing, I wasn't getting stronger at a fast enough rate. Since The Factory's opening I have gone up from a v2 to a solid v4 and even accomplishing some v5s. I've also started climbing competitively and have podiumed (1st & 2nd place) at \u00a0every competition I've competed at. The membership rates are higher but you get what you pay for and their rates are on par with every gym except for Rock City who probably has the lowest rates in the country. But again, The Factory is new and fresh and has a dedicated membership base, no screaming kids there for birthday parties or overcrowding.

I walked into The Factory back in January, without a clue in my mind as to what I was doing. None. Nada. Nothing. When I say beginner I mean beginner. I just knew that I wanted to try something new and fun and when I yelped rock climbing, The Factory came up. So in I go with the Sidekick and the place is empty as they had just opened. Alex, one of the employees, greeted us and quickly set us up. Again, not knowing what to do, he took the time to explain the different walls to us, what the tags meant and the fundamentals of getting up the wall and coming back down. I had no chalk with me so he brought out his own bag for us to use. Nice! Fast forward 5 months later and I'm a full fledge member. I love The Factory so much that I decided to try a groupon for a different climbing gym (which will rename nameless) and it just blew chunks! If you are new to the sport and want to just give it a try, I really recommend stopping in. Everyone is friendly and helpful, including the other members. It gets crowded in the evenings but on the weekends in the mornings it's pretty quiet. I believe they will be expanding in the future so definitely, new challenges to come.

Yes, there are other rock climbing gyms, but they mainly cater to top roping so I was delighted to hear that there was a bouldering only gym opening here in nearby Orange and that for their grand opening, it was FREE all day! Can't beat free.I came here yesterday to check out the place with my boyfriend and a friend. Overall we were impressed. There were plenty of problems for all climbing levels. I think in all there were about 180 climbing routes, ranging from VB to V12. There were even VS routes for climbing shenanigans? \u00a0I didn't try those though. They looked a little too crazy. The gym has a very clean layout, something I also liked. The climbing walls were at the perimeter of the squared location, with rest spots and carpeting in the center. The mats all along the side were built in and also comfortable to land on.Downsides: I didn't find the staff particularly friendly. Being a frequent climber at Rock City, I guess I have a higher standard when it comes to service at a rock climbing gym. Also, prices here are a little higher than that at competing gyms.", "date": "4/22/2012"}

Building better climbers. I find it funny how I can only climb at a V3 level which is comparable to outdoor levels here but at other gym flash V5's. The setters aren't trying to make people feel good about so called levels and rather give the perception of what real climbs outdoors might be like.

The people that are climbing are the same, awesome people. They will talk to anyone, give you tips even invite you out to climbs. As for the actual gym itself, its great. Unlike some gyms that use tape to mark the route, Factory Bouldering uses holds which are the same color. So it's pretty hard to get lost or to figure out where to start. It may not sound like a big deal, but after visiting some gyms such as Rock City, a gym where few routes are labeled, it's just a nice feature. It helps out tremendously. \u00a0They also have a variety of routes for everyone. Unlike some gyms that are geared more towards advanced climbers with a majority of routes rated at V6 or something or other, Factory provides routes for climbers of all skill. Another nice thing about this place is the different types of climbs. While it's all bouldering, there are walls which are almost completely vertical and then there are walls which are angled very steeply. The gym is also very clean. You'd think everything in there is new. The holds have very little chalk on them, the crash pads look brand new.

It's the best. It's not a big fancy facility like a lot of gyms try to be. It's a small one story facility in a little industrial complex next to boring business offices. But it's the inside that matters. Inside is, what I can only describe as a \"lounge\" surrounded by 10-12 foot boulder problems ranging from V0/VB - V10 and maybe a V11. So whether you're a noob (like me) or Daniel Woods himself, you'll find a route that will challenge you. The prices are fair to say the least. A one day pass runs you $11 but if you arrive before 2pm the price is $8. Shoe rentals and chalk are reasonably priced and a one day trip to the Factory should only run you about 20 bucks tops! Not bad. If you love climbing, I'd suggest getting a membership. They run you $50/month, but the amount of perks you get makes it worth it. Once a month you get to bring a friend for free and if you're a member you get access to all the events they put on like BBQs and whatnot. The only moderate downside is that the weightlifting area is very small and very rudimentary. If you're looking to workout at a formal gym, the Factory is not it. But it's an OUTSTANDING climbing gym. The boulder problems are changed frequently enough to where you won't get bored, but they remain up long enough for you to really put some time and effort into completing the more challenging ones. The grades are slightly more difficult than listed in my opinion. At the Factory, I can barely do a V2. At SenderOne, I send V3-V4 no sweat. So as the Factory Bouldering's motto goes, \"Building Better Climbers\" is 100% true. Whether you're looking to build better climbing strength, or if you just want to try indoor rock climbing for the first time, the Factory Bouldering has it all in a clean, spacious, and fairly uncrowded format that will suit climbers of all ability.", "date": "1/19/2015"}

All I can say is that the people at this gym really care about what they do. They change up about 20-25% of the routes every 2 weeks or so, and about once a month they do a big ~50% route change. I have yet to come in here bored of all the routes in the gym. In over a year of coming just about once a week, I am comfortably climbing V2-V3 routes here. I really feel a lot more comfortable climbing in general, and I know I wouldn't have been if I didn't go to Factory. I've also been bringing many friends here, who have all had great times here. They have plenty of easy routes from VB-V1 for beginners. I've even brought kids 6-12 here and they've enjoyed themselves. I know that a lot of gyms either have bouldering areas that are really tall or have crashpads you have to move. I personally feel that the variety, the height, and the manner the pads are laid out in the gym caters very well to visitors and beginners. I would highly recommend this place to anyone curious about the world of Bouldering. Note that the ratings here are typically more difficult that most gyms.

All of the problems are so thoughtfully set, and climbing them is such a pleasure. They also reset more often than any gym I know. So even if there is a problem you don't like, it won't be there for long. Another reason I love this gym is for the angles of the walls. So many gyms these days try to get so creative with their walls and they have so many inconsistent angle changes. Think of all the classic problems outside. They're just good holds at one angle. The Factory has slab, a little steep, steeper, and even more steep, and they don't overlap. It's fantastic! Their motto is, \"Building Better Climbers,\" and that truly is what they are doing with the wonderful problems and all the training tools they have. There is a campus board, several hang boards, and rings, so you can get stronger even when you aren't in the mood to work on problems. And it seems as though they are always getting new holds. They never paint them, so they are always gritty and friction-y. I believe the owner, Louie, shapes a lot of the holds for several companies, so they get some really cool shapes for the holds as well. If you are a beginner, don't be intimidated. The staff here is very helpful. Just tell them it's your first time, and they will walk you through the entire gym, and tell you all you need to know about climbing in a gym. And if you have any questions, you can just ask them and they are always more than willing to help. The cleanliness of this gym is also a huge plus. It is very well maintained, and they have those cool Dyson hand dryers in the bathroom. So fancy! The only thing I would change is about this gym is the campus board. I would love to see the Metolius rungs instead of what is there, and I would put up a sign telling climbers not to use the rungs as footholds because it gets all rubbery and hard to hold onto. It's hard to convince my boyfriend to come here if he can't get a good campus session in.", "date": "4/16/2013"}

But because of this I know how hard Louie and Val, and the whole community, worked on this gym. Like home cooked food its made with love. I could definitely see myself spending alot of time at the gym which is significant because Im really not that into boulder and prefer climbing outside. The problems are fun, technical, and challenging without driving me nuts. If opening day is any indication the community in the OC is very welcoming I meet lots of very nice and supportive climbers. I would definitely recommended this gym!", "date": "4/24/2012"}

VB - Hella easy. i made it to the top quickly. V0 and V1 - VERY challenging. bf's friend even said some V2's were challenging for him and he's been rock climbing for awhile.quick notes:- this place isn't for kids. unless they are very advanced. - the rocks here are still fairly new so they are a bit rough around the edges.- i don't think they have harnesses. - they have sticker's on some levels indicating that the level will be removed and another challenging level will takes it's spot. that's a plus if you go rock climbing often. new levels to tackle all the time.- this place is very open and huge. since it's new, there aren't a lot of people so you don't have to worry about someone breathing down your back.- there's padding below you so if you loose your footing and fall you won't break any bones.the staff is very friendly and the people who come here are very friendly too. if you get stuck with a level someone will always be willing to help you out.", "date": "6/21/2012"}
