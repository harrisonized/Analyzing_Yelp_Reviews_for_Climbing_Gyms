Problems don't seem very creative or fun. Everything is a top-out with no easy down-climb if top-outs freak you out. And they took out the only vertical/slab bouldering wall to create more overhang. Sucks for us mortals. This alone has got me thinking of cancelling my membership.2. There's no secure bike parking. PG isn't as accessible as MC or Dogpatch, so getting there by bike is the best option. I'd love to see indoor or valet parking.3. I got spoiled by the amenities of their sister gym, Earth Treks in Virginia. A few highlights: expansive bouldering area with lots of variety, huge locker room, electronic lockers, free evening parking, a foot shower(!), cleaner facility, bigger (35,000 square feet of climbing), Walltopia walls.There are a lot of positives too: nice view, tall top-rope/lead walls, cool bouldering 'elevator' to the second level, 25,000 square feet is still pretty good, nice staff.", "date": "9/29/2018"}

Don't worry about being a newbie - they've got it covered - with a quick, register over a stand-up tablet and then relieving you of $20 (usual $4 shoe rental in addition to the $20 is free for first timers), you are required to watch a quick safety video and off you go to the walls!The first thing you will notice here is that everyone is nice - from the desk jockeys who check you in to the gym rats - everyone is nice and easy going. Let's be honest, this is not an easy sport, but it is a fun sport! You can challenge yourself to \"flash\" a wall (make it up first time) or, like me, just make it up the d*$n wall. The premises are well kept-the warehouse style building has whole walls that open up to plain-air so the atmosphere is very light and airy. If your grip (or legs) wear out there's other things to do - work on cardio, lift a little or take part in one of the myriad of yoga or climbing classes - just go. This is truly a fun sport you can get hooked on! After your work out - hit the showers and refresh in the sauna - this is a great place for a really fun work out!", "date": "2/7/2016"}

I needed something to break my usual dance/yoga routine and my friend JUST happened to be the bouldering expert. Knowing he's an awesome friend, I knew I was in good hands. Plus, I can't turn down an oppurtunity to work out at one of the most amazing place ever! \u00a0have you seen views of the Golden Gate bridge across Chrissy Field? why, YES. I'll sweat if I have a view like THAT. A day pass is just $19 and $4 for shoe rental.Little did I know that climbing would bring out the dirty side of both of us. \u00a0I didn't think I'd be coming up with lame lines like , \"damn, check out that ass!\", \"dude, you look good in spandex. \u00a0No, I mean, you look REALLY good in spandex\" or \"Can I dip my hand in your chalk bag?\" (wink, wink) Kidding aside, climbing builds strength not only in your upper body and legs, but it's all about strategy too. Doing a V0 versus V3 requires a totally different set of skills. And even if you think you mapped out the rock wall in your head, once you actually start climbing it, it can be a whole different ball game. I also like the fact that bouldering develops your problem solving skills. And color coordination skills. And hand and eye motor skills. Can't really say that about running on a treadmill right?If at the end of the hour, your forearms don't feel tight, your hands aren't raw or you haven't chipped your nails, you're doing it wrong. Bruises on your knees the next day definitely earn you extra bragging rights. R-E-S-P-E-C-T. I hope I've inspired you to give bouldering a try. \u00a0Just remember to climb the wall with courage, keep moving up and hold onto the rock with every ounce of strength you've got. \u00a0And for heaven's sake, don't look down.", "date": "6/3/2013"}

Really enjoy the place but I do have a few gripes with it.Cons:1) They close sooo early on the weekends. Only open until 6pm on Sundays? C'mon, I would at least stay open until 8pm like they do on Saturdays. I would definitely take advantage of that.2) No wifi. Some of us like to stream TV or music while working out on the treadmills and other aerobic machines. Also, I will sometimes stream workouts (since I'm new to this) and it would be great if I didn't have to use data to do so (plus, my iPad is wifi only so that's out of the question).3) It gets insanely crowded in the evenings. I understand that issue is difficult to solve since that's when everyone gets off work, but it's still a huge bummer. As a beginner, I can only take advantage of the V0 and V1 routes in bouldering, which means when it's crowded I don't have a lot of options and don't get much climbing in. Maybe they could explore alternate membership options (1 location only, Morning-only memberships/Evening-only memberships, specific day of the week memberships, etc). I don't really fault them for this though, but it may impact the value of a membership for some people so I thought I'd share.4) I'm new to this whole exercise thing and want to start going to the Yoga classes. Have attended 1 so far and enjoyed it, but it is a rather large time commitment. The shortest \"beginner\" yoga class is an hour and a half (90 minutes), the other is an hour and 45 minutes. Wish there was a real beginner yoga class that was only an hour to help people like me get up to speed so the other classes become options.*While these cons aren't the worst, they're still pretty disappointing. Planet Granite recently raised their prices, and so I would hope that means they could fix cons #1 and #2 at least.Pros:1) Large, well kept facilities2) Lots of climbing routes, especially bouldering3) A good variety of other equipment, so it's really not just a climbing gym4) Yoga (and other classes) are included with the membership5) Sauna in the locker rooms6) Overall, a really versatile and eclectic gym that does include some awesome things.In short:Would I pay the full membership price for Planet Granite? Not sure given the cons. The family discount is the real reason I'm still a member. If my boyfriend decides to stop going 'cause of his new work schedule and the crowds in the evenings, I may have to stop going too. All that said, it's a really great place, just not sure if it's worth the money depending on your schedule, physical ability, and finances.", "date": "9/9/2016"}

As a relatively novice climber, I was surprised with what I saw which prompted this review. Before I forget, let me share all the good things about this place. Large space, beautiful scenery options for bouldering, top roping and lead climbing. While it's hard to say that any rock gym has reasonable prices I'd say their rates are still competitive. Adequate and good variety of alternative gym equipment, including yoga (and i think fitness) classes to use, so if you get a membership I'd say it may be worth while. Clean bathrooms, shower area, sauna AND towel service free of additional charge which seems rare for SF.Now for tough news. There seems to be a lack of general safety concerns from both staff and patrons. Staff appear very aloof and laissez faire with their responsibilities. Not sure if they are relying on the liability waivers that they make everyone sign...but here are my qualms. There were two instances while I was already on the wall climbing when other patrons (one lead climbing the other top roping) that decided it would be a good idea to climb a problem that cross climbed mine. Making it difficult to finish my own and/or descend as well as gave my belayer a tough time maneuvering and lowering. There seemed to be a lack of respect, general understanding and the inherent risk factors involved in these situations from these two particular patrons but in general this appeared to transpire elsewhere within the gym. Other safety concerns were with the way majority of patrons belaying their friends. I saw frequent break-hand removal, belayers taking both break and guide hands off completely and relying on the grigri cam fully. IMO recommended gym belay method is PBUS...anything else is downright reckless. I was also baffled by the number of patrons with very old harnesses...I'm talking 15+ years old. Based on the people that go here, this is an indoor rock climbing community, not a rock climbing community. There are a lot of average to mediocre climbers who are interested in socializing and hanging out after work and get a few cool climbs and dyno moves in. Nothing wrong with that but safety is not their main concern and I wouldn't want anyone to be injured by reckless or negligent climbers. I would not recommend this gym to the serious climbers out there. I recommend PG staff pay closer attention to their patrons lack of understanding for this dangerous sport.", "date": "4/14/2017"}

I haven't met anyone here that made me feel awkward for being a noob at climbing lol. There are a lot of fun routes that are updated pretty regularly. The right half of the gym is mostly top rope and lead climbing, whereas the left side is bouldering. It gets pretty busy in the evenings usually but I've found Sunday mornings are the best because it's pretty empty in the gym then. Parking can suck on the weekdays but I've gotten lucky most of the time. Free parking after 7 pm though!Getting into rock climbing is definitely pricy but it's worth it. It's a great workout and a ton of fun! If you're a noob like me, try the beginning rock climbing class -- it's an excellent crash course into climbing to get you started!", "date": "9/30/2015"}

Really only the inside circle and a couple on one other wall. Compared to Sunnyvale there is not a lot. BUT the view usually makes up for this. The gym itself doesn't do it for me. I don't like how the cardio equipment is spread haphazardly across balconies and stuffed into any extra corner. It's just not inviting - they need a more dedicated space for all the gym equipment but don't have the room. So unfortunately I'm also paying for a crunch membership to complement the climbing. Also slightly annoying is the location. While beautiful, it's a long haul from most things. I love that it's close to the marina, just wish a little closer.

My belay instructor was helpful and patient. I've never even stepped foot in a climbing gym before this and I wasn't too overwhelmed.

I quickly became addicted and Planet Granite is the place to be. Located next to Crissy Field in the Marina, there's both bouldering and top roping available. You need to take a belay lesson in order to top rope, but no lesson is needed for bouldering. Bouldering \u00a0(climbing on lower rocks without a rope) can be more challenging, but it's also more social. It's not uncommon for other climbers to help you with your climb or cheer you on when you reach the top. I also love that they change up the routes often, creating new and fun problems to solve.The staff is extremely friendly and always willing to help. If you want to learn good climbing technique and improve your skills, I'd recommend the Balance and Technique class.

I usually feel its unnecessary and that person must have just had a bad day, and needed to blow off some steam. But I've been a member at PG for a few years now and have become increasingly disappointed and frustrated with the way things are handled at the gym. I feel the gym has become more of a day care for children than a climbing gym. I know its a business and we are all trying to make money to survive in this expensive city, but come on. I like to hit the gym for some lead climbing and top roping sessions in the later afternoon 3-5 pm, before the mad dash of adults that fill up the routes in the evening which make lead climbing certain routes too dangerous. So the bracket of time that I am there it must be day care for the kids. Theres usually at least two to three large groups of kids that fill up the climbing areas, with only one or two babysitters/belayers/instructors whatever you want to call them. So obviously they can only have one or two kids climb at a time, while the other kids run like wild banshees bouncing off the walls, screaming, hanging on the walls under routes that we are working on ( which is very dangerous while my partner is lead climbing.) Its a disaster waiting to happen. One day this week, My climbing buddy and I were working on a difficult route in the back corner of a climbing room. At least one of the instructors warned us it may get loud in here... but I didn't expect that 10 kids would be throwing bean bags across the room at the walls and running back and forth launching themselves onto the walls... over and over again. stampeding and yelling. It was a joke! The kids were screaming so loudly I couldn't even hear my buddy's request for certain things while he was on the wall, which is a huge safety factor. At one point a couple kids started bouldering on the route directly below the route that we were climbing. If my climbing buddy fell, he would have crushed him since he wasn't even that far up the route. I of course, took the initiative and told the child to go somewhere else to be safe.. But Im paying 140$ or so bucks a month for a family membership and I also have to babysit and tell kids to get out of harms way? Its not that I don't like children, I really enjoy being around them but this gym has become a playground for parents to drop off their children to wear them out. Can there be a designated section of a kid only area, and sound proof it? I sure these babysitting groups are bringing in a bunch of money, so move to a separate building just for kids? Climbing can be dangerous and this behavior is a lawsuit waiting to happen. I come here to work out and relax, not checking around constantly for loose children that can be in harms way. The only reason I come to this gym is for the easy location, awesome views of the bay, and to practice my lead climbing. I'm seriously thinking of canceling our membership because this has gotten out of control. Oh and if you forget your yoga mat one day for one of their classes, they actually charge you 1$ to rent it. Mission cliffs at least provided free mats for their members. You think it would be included in the expensive membership price that keeps increasing every year. The front desk people are usually rude about it too. ITs a shame since this gym has a lot of potential but it looks like they are moving away from being an actual climbing gym. More like a jungle gym.", "date": "12/14/2016"}

I know it's just a \"thing\" that the staff a gyms are sort of stuck up but I have never experienced mother fuckerdom of this degree at anywhere in my life. Fire those people into the sun!All in all, if you're a local, get a membership and avoid the staff as much as possible, and you'll be fine. If you're not, maybe check out some other place or climb outdoors.", "date": "8/22/2013"}

The routes are thoughtfully set, interesting, and appropriately challenging, and are re-set often enough that there's not much time to get bored, but not so often that you don't have enough time to project whatever it is you're working on.2. The weight room/fitness area/cardio machines are all I can ask for. I've never had to wait to use the squat rack or the treadmill or whatever. 3. The yoga teachers are great. I've been practicing yoga for a long time, and have taken classes at many different places, and the teachers here are comparable to the best, offering classes for all levels without too much preachy woo-woo.Now the negative. 1. The staff are hit-and-miss. Some are great, but I find many aloof and unfriendly, which I can understand if you work at the same place you workout and you don't want to be everybody's buddy. But, come on: don't be a dick.2. The locker rooms are hit-and-miss. They're often filthy, with hair-clogged drains, lockers that smell like rock shoes, and dirty towels lying about on the floor for hours. I think the place could be stellar if their staff were more consistently friendly, and they had a full-time custodian to keep the locker rooms clean. As it is, I still highly recommend Planet Granite. The positives outweigh the negatives by a long shot.", "date": "12/11/2014"}

I would go to Mission Cliffs with a friend because I would be able to teach them belaying on their first time.

Climbing: As a beginner climber, this is a great place to get started. There is a good spread of easier routes, starting even from \"5.Fun.\" Now, as more of an intermediate climber, I really appreciate the variety of upper level routes, both on the short and tall walls. All the ropes have permanent GriGris, so no need to bring your own belay device. The holds are generally clean and not sticky or grimy like at other places. They routes are also well-marked (all the holds are the same color, rather than marking the route by tape... which can be really difficult to navigate IMO). The bouldering area is awesome, too, with several top-out areas. Routes are changed pretty frequently - good for keeping things new and exciting, although sometimes if you take too long to work on a problem it might be gone the next time you're there! Crowd: A wide mix of ages. Seems to be pretty kid-friendly on the weekends. More of a 20s-30s after-work crowd on weeknights. Definitely gets busier from 7-9 on weeknights, and you might have to wait a couple minutes to get on certain routes. I've had all positive interactions with other climbers here - in general there's a friendly, laid-back, and non-judgmental attitude.Staff: Really helpful and friendly!Location: Being in the Presidio is one of the best things about this gym (think gorgeous views of the Golden Gate bridge as you top out on a bouldering problem) but can also be one of the biggest pitfalls if you don't have a car, since it's pretty hard to get to by public transportation. Even with a car, parking can be difficult on weekends since there are also lots of people going to Crissy Field and to the trampoline gym next door.Other amenities: Clean locker rooms with showers, weights/cardio equipment (not very extensive but has basic equipment), two yoga studios (I have yet to take a class but they seem quite popular!), a gear store (10% off for members). They also have different events, including a singles night (to meet new climbing partners) and member appreciation nights.", "date": "1/29/2016"}

I took my little brother and my friend here to climb this past sunday, hoping to introduced them to rock climbing.

Being the only one who had experience belaying, I was naturally put to be the designated belayer of the day (which was fine with me!). The staff (Jackie) was nice to inform me that they don't charge the belayer (which if I hadn't known, I would have just paid!), and she were really accommodating with the belay test. I usually use ATC, but this gym uses GriGri, so Jackie was nice to show me the difference really quickly, no problemo.

The sequence of lowering and stopping is repeated until the earth is reached.The climbing level that I've seen so far in this gym ranges from 5.1 to 5.12 but up until 5.15 is climbable.We tried the bouldering first which is a good start before the rope climbing with belay. \u00a0I made it to the top of the 2 sections for 5 climbs. \u00a0It was really cool reaching the top. Even though we're a bit tired we ke[t on going on.

At that time, I was in no shape to evaluate this gym because I spent most of my time thinking about...erm...survival, because those tall, seemingly treacherous climbing walls spooked the living daylights out of time. But as I began to climb more and more, I realized two things - 1) There is no way you can fall as long as you've done your due diligence with your ropes and your harness, 2) Planet Granite is actually, a really cool and awesome gym. The place is predominantly a climbing gym - with multiple top roping and lead climbing routes and a bouldering area. The place also offers climbing lessons and periodic Yoga classes. It also has your regular cardio and weights stuff, but it seems like just a bonus add-on. If you're into climbing or want to learn how to climb rocks, this place is pretty solid. But if you just want to do your regular gymmy workout routine, then coming here is going to feel like a rip-off. The monthly membership costs ~$75 while if you are there just for a day, you could get a day pass for $20. If you work out the math, membership makes much more sense if you plan to come here more than 4 times a month. You can rent shoes and a harness at the counter, but if you're starting to like climbing and want to take it to the next level, I recommend you to buy Planet Granite's starter climbing pack which consists of shoes, a harness and a chalk bag at ~$125, which as my more experienced climber friends tell me, is a good deal. If you are completely new to climbing, you should take an introductory free lesson where they'll teach you how to use a harness, how to tie knots, how to belay etc, which is super duper essential to learn.The gym is pretty spacious, with lots of climbing routes across different difficulty levels. Even though the gym is pretty crowded most of the time, I've never waited too long to get on to a route I wanted to go on. There is a small bouldering area which is always packed with bare-chested men showing off their skills, while a crowd of on-lookers scrutinizes their moves. I don't really dare venture out into that area, at least not yet.The location of this gym is also pretty sweet. Though it's a bit of a hassle to get there if you don't own a car (you can't really get to the Presidio with public transportation), once you get there, the view of the Golden Gate bridge will take your breath away and motivate you to climb those rocks, even if you are too scared to do so!", "date": "12/15/2014"}

They even had a fun lounge so that you could rest your feet and fingers. The weight room had a raw aspect to it - I loved the olympic style weight lifting section.I am impressed with the men's locker room: a nice locker room area with great saunas, clean bathrooms, clean floors, etc. The staff is friendly and willing to help you out.

The other top off area leads you to a lounge area where you can rest after sending a difficult problem.

I'll update once I've been elsewhere!I visited Planet Granite during a weekend trip to SF, my friend had recently picked up rock climbing as a hobby and was keen on introducing her little brother and me to the experience (I've also been wanting to try it out after hearing about her experiences). Upon walking into Planet Granite, the first thing I noticed was that it smelled like major time musty BO, which wasn't pleasant at all. They could do well with more ventilation for sure, but that might have been because we came in on the afternoon of a day long bouldering competition. We were also disappointed that when we arrived around 3 on a Sunday, the 3:30pm belaying class listed on the Planet Granite website was cancelled, and as such, my friend didn't have a certified belayer. Sucks.Thankfully, the rest of the experience was completely positive. The employees were very nice, quickly got us our rental equipment and allowed us free reign onto the walls. The facilities which include a small weight lifting area (maybe crossfit? great equipment from what I observed), the locker room, and the rock climbing area were all clean. Even though the gym was crowded, there were plenty of walls to climb on, and I don't think I've waited more than a couple of minutes to climb the wall I wanted to attempt. The walls themselves were arranged in a variety of ways, I definitely got a drastically different challenge (or lack thereof on the easier ones) on each wall. I don't remember which orange wall I kept having problems with, but the next time I'm back I'll definitely conquer it!All in all, Planet Granite is a good gym in a good location that gave me a great first rock climbing experience.", "date": "10/26/2013"}

Moreover the bouldering area is also good in size. I also took climbing classes at PG and the instructor was pretty helpful throughout the month. Yoga classes are great as well. I recommend Charles on Monday evenings. They also have some free weights and cardio stuff. Of course it's not epic but definitely does the job complimenting to climbing. They also have events for kids, singles, etc. and they bring some famous climbers for private classes and tips. If you are looking for a rock climbing gym in Bay Area, PG is what you're looking for.

There are lots and lots of bouldering walls and rock climbing walls that will make your neck crane.The locker rooms are clean and well-kept. This isn't just a climbing gym, it's got a full gym, with plenty of elipticals, treadmills, free weights and there's also a set of kettle bells. I don't even have kettle bells at MY gym. They offer a student discount for monthly memberships and a day pass is $19 plus $4 for shoe rental. Discounted prices on Monday-Friday before 5pm is $15. And if you're gonna park in the parking lot, you have to make sure you pay for parking at the little parking permit kiosk. Free parking starts at 7pm.", "date": "5/11/2012"}

This is the newest of the three Planet Granite gyms in the Bay Area, and they chose one of the most beautiful locations in all of San Francisco to situate the gym: Chrissy Field. On nice, sunny days, you get a gorgeous view of the Golden Gate Bridge as you drive up. On not so sunny days, you still get a gorgeous view of the city and the bay, just without the bridge looming in the distance.The climbing walls here seem much taller and the problems much harder than those at PG SV, probably because they have so many more overhung routes. They even have a ramp in the bouldering area, so you can practice prolonged overhung climbing. On some of the climbing routes, you can reward yourself by looking through the windows at an amazing view of the city skyline at the top, from the Exploratorium to the Transamerica building. The best times to come visit are on weekdays in the middle of the day when it's almost empty. If you come on a weekend, you may find yourself having to park all the way at the end of the road or at Planet Granite.

If I was not already locked into a year agreement with my current gym I would be here. Unfortunately, I only started coming here about two months ago. This rock climbing gym is by far the best in San Francisco. The prices of entry are very reasonable at about under $40 for the day pass, plus rental equipment if you don't have your own. It's reasonable to me if you are coming one or two weekend days of a month and just want to rock out. They also have monthly and yearly rates that you can also sign up for, I believe I may do that myself, once I get the chance. You also have access to their standard set of machine and free weight gyms. Their bathrooms are also top notch as well, with lockers, showers, toilets and plenty of sinks.So many different climbing choices. If you are new, you can take classes to get started, which they offer at conveniently scheduled times. If you have a little experience and a partner that can belay, you can start immediately on puzzles that start from 5.3 all the way up to 5.16s i believe. There is also a separate section for bouldering, where you can choose puzzles that range from V0 to V16 (near horizontal). The gym does tend to get crowded around 1 or 2 on saturdays and sundays. So it is advised that you try to arrive around 10 or 11 on those weekend days, if you really want to get your climbs in without being rushed. The scenery could also not be any more perfect. You are about 100 yards away from the actual shoreline/beach. A note about the staff, I think they are much used to seeing customers with at least some knowledge of rock climbing, but if you are completely new, it is best to be sure that you sign up for the introductory course over the phone prior to coming. Also, belaying intro test/lesson do need to be reserved at least a day in advance.", "date": "9/17/2011"}

Weekends in the morning seem to be just as busy with more children running around and climbing the walls. \u00a0With that said, parking can be somewhat of a pain during these busy periods (hence, the 4 instead of 5 star rating).", "date": "2/2/2012"}

Everyone else started off with a 5.10a so i tried to do a 5.9 on my first go. Climbed a few feet then gave up. Top-rope fail.This place is a great place to climb because they have such a wide variety of walls for all levels. After failing at the harder difficulties, I decided to start lower at 5.6 and completed two fairly easily. I worked my way up to a 5.7 and ended my day on finishing that.

The climbing area is large and has lots of different problems that seem to change somewhat often. The gym is in good condition and their yoga classes are really good (This is from the perspective of someone who never did yoga before joining). Janet, the Wednesday night fundamentals of flow teacher, has been particularly helpful and seems to take particular care to make sure that her new students aren't doing something wrong that could end up hurting themselves. The other yoga classes I've been to - those taught by Charles or Mary have also been quite good.Minor issues --I haven't quite been able to figure out how to get a guest signed up for a belay class in an easy manner. It would be nice to be able to come with someone have them be able to learn how to belay (or just review the main knot for people who haven't done this in a while, because we aren't suppose to show people how to do this ourselves, probably for insurance reasons) really quickly so we could climb together, but from what I can tell you have to call in advance and they might only have one time a day when they teach the class. People who know how to belay can just pass the test relatively quickly so this is really only an issue for my friends who forgot how to tie the knots.-They do a crossfit class here on M/W nights that take up a large part of the lifting area. Apparently it's moving to 9pm, which will be good for people at peak lifting times but means it will be harder to get in some lifting after a yoga class. (But maybe I should be lifting before stretching anyway)-Parking can be quite annoying, it's not great on weekday night but \u00a0weekend afternoons are worse.Overall, it's definitely a great gym.

I was originally going to go to Mission Cliffs after having several good experiences with customer service there, but I decided to try Planet Granite because I had received my belay card there a few months ago at their Sunnyvale location. Not to mention, every time I go rock climbing I'm graced with unfriendly jeers from more experienced rock climbers. I understand that it's an underground sport and existing members don't want to have the place crawling with new people, but I genuinely enjoy rock climbing .. Is that a crime? I was seriously hoping it'd be a different story here, but I guess not ... This place is crawling with junky hipsters trying their best to keep the rest of mainstream society away from their damn property. BUT TODAY, I had forgotten my certified belay pass so I had to retake the belay test for a temporary day pass. That's fine, I understand - Safety first. After a little practice, my boyfriend and I (who had also forgot his belay card) decided that we were ready to take the test, so I let the front desk know and a nice young gentleman told me to get strapped in. So I did just that .. and DAYS later I was still strapped in waiting to get certified. I look over at the counter and there are about 4 or 5 customer reps just laughing and chatting away .. So at this point, my patience was drawing thin .. I just wanted to get certified .. After a little while of waiting, the same guy came up to certify me and asked, \"Have you taken classes before?\" To which I replied \"Yes, I have previously - I was just practicing over there with my friend\" And out of no where, this RUDE ASS HIPSTER GIRL with a tattoo on her upper left arm interrupts me mid sentence and says, \"YOU CAN'T DO THAT. You can't practice here, you can't teach your friend how to belay!!! We're not going to certify you!!!\" And I'm standing here thinking to myself, 'SCUSE ME?! First of all - way to GLORIFY the bourgeois-all-knowing-hipster asshole persona. Second of all - you came in mid story! You have no right to call me out. If you stayed for the whole damn story, you'd understand that WE BOTH ALREADY KNOW HOW TO BELAY. Third - RUDE. Yo momma must not have taught you some damn manners interrupting me mid sentence. After her rude episode, she decided to stay on the side hovering - extremely dissatisfied with a grimace on her face, mugging at us the entire time. If her comment didn't already put us in a bad mood, her facial expression sure as hell did. Mind you - the only reason why I'm giving two stars is because of the one nice guy with the treble clef tattoo who had to apologize for his rude ass co worker, so cheers to him!Anyhow, 20 minutes in, my friends and I are pretty disgruntled with the way hipster chick handled the entire situation. I was already a little embarrassed to have brought my friend here for the first time, but that wasn't the end of it .. the general atmosphere of the other climbers was horrible as well .. So what if she's an adult climbing a 5.3? Is that a problem? Seriously? It's Easter, y'all. Jesus is watching - the least you could do is smile or look busy mindin' yo own damn business instead of mean mugging while she's climbing. The atmosphere here is a no-no ...", "date": "1/26/2015"}

I'm a frequent gym surfer and I always love to hit a planet granite to test my metal and max out climbing the array of challenging problems created by their awesome setters! The Presidio location is right up there with the best of them. They have, in my opinion, the longest traverse problems of any gym in the bay area! I prefer more realistic problems compared to most indoor scaling. Here you'll get a more true to outdoor rating then at most gyms. That's not to say you wont find equally awesome problems at all the gyms in our climbing mecca of the Bay Area, but if you really want to know the most comparable problems indoor to outdoor, here is a good place to start! The gym itself is super clean. Its not as spacious as the other PG's, and the height of the walls aren't up there like \u00a0the Sunnyvale location, but the complexity of the wall formation and problem implementation is amazing!They have what I think is the longest cave over hang of any gym in the bay. I love to boulder, and I find in the off season, when its usually too wet to get out doors, coming here really keeps me honed. I also find more enjoyment when you can top out on bouldering problems and there are a bunch here where you can. The top-roping and lead walls are super challenging, and offer great views of the bay as you climb. I think this is the only gym that offers an actual stalactite climbing feature. The location is prime. Situated right next to Chrissy Field overlooking the Golden Gate, and Downtown SF, you can't ask for a better place to chill out on a lazy afternoon, especially in the warmer months. They have a large locker rooms with sauna, free weights area, machines, and lots of cardio. I also believe they offer cross fit, and an assortment of classes. The structure was built from an old loading facility, so the platform design is quite unique, with a small dinning area near the up stairs bouldering wall and a matted stretching and calisthenics platform that's especially cool. There are also a couple yoga studios upstairs. Its the standard daily rates, about 18 bucks for a day pass, a little over than 20 for shoes and harness. They also offer a short climbing class for beginners. If you get there early enough they offer an early bird rate for $14. One things for sure, the initiation and monthly membership fee is outrageous, us poor rock hounds could never afford it. I highly recommend this gym, and would encourage anyone to climb here at least once.", "date": "12/9/2010"}

They have \"garage doors\" that are open during the better weather, which helps in creating good air circulation, so that this place doesn't smell like feet.They also have a small cross fit facility complete with kettle bells, pull up bars, and soft weight plates, which is awesome, since I intend to probably cool down with some kb swings.Staff was polite and friendly.

The walls there are a bit taller than those at the SF Planet Granite, but the SF PG has more spread out routes that are a lot more fun. Plus, you belay with a gri gri, which is a good bit more convenient than a normal carabiner when your arms are tired. The staff at Mission Cliffs were nice as well, but I just like the staff at PG better. Except for this one douche, who thinks he's hella tight and is showing off his climbing like a complete tool.The regular workout gym is cool, too. It's one of the few places that has things like gymnast rings, kettle balls, row machines, and jumping boxes. Plus you can't beat an after-workout sauna, plus individual showers with curtains (something that mission cliffs doesn't have). Haven't tried the yoga yet.

THE BOULDERING AREA IS AWESOME. you can traversal from the first floor to the second floor! also, for the chicken down climbers such as myself, the routes where you can just climb up and no need to down climb is so thoughtful of the person who designed this place!4. they have their own parking lot with a good amount of parking spaces5. all their rope uses the gregre (anti lock belaying device), which makes me feel safer 6. they have a sauna in the locker room7. the yoga instructors are all very nice8. their gym is huge9. the gym is clean10. the routes are challenging and involve technique cons1. their bouldering area is taped only lol2. the parking lot sometimes are pretty packed bc ppl who wants to visit crissy fields, the trampoline gym or the pool parks there too.3. it's in presideo and hard for ppl who dont have any means of transportation to get there. never taken the bus so not sure how fast or convenient it is4. yoga isnt available all day during the week. which is understandable if they dont have a huge yogi following like a yoga studio. but i've caught myself going to yoga studios for some yoga classes during the day during the week... when i have a membership herea few weeks ago i finally climbed at mission cliffs for the first time ever. i hated it there. my climbing partner (who's been climbing way longer than me and have been to multiple climbing gyms around the world) told me that actually PG is the best gyms he's been to, no other climbing gym is like them and i've been spoiled.", "date": "12/29/2010"}

I've been a member of PG since moving to the city in May 2009 and PG has everything you would want in a gym. New, updated machines and equipment, two studios for yoga, treadmills and precor machines and of course climbing walls. The Good: Membership $70/month with everything included, super clean, good yoga class spread throughout the day, two 40ft lead walls with a good combo of lead climbs from 5.9 to 12d. Climbing Classes are small, frequent, relevant. Gear deals are nice too ( Evolv Defy + Black Diamond Momentum AL/Primrose AL Harness+ Kreig Chalk Bag + CHalk Ball = intro gear package for $120; Rack of 10 BD Livewire Quickdraws for $188.00 and intro trad rack for $445.00)The Bad: This place gets packed at night, so if you are going to climb I recommend the weekend or early morning. The ugly: PARKING BLOWS, especially on weekday nights. A Comment on Climbing: PG is a great place to learn how to climb. As someone who just got back into climbing, PG offers a nice introduction to climbing with a good mixture of strength and technique based climbs. However, after recently becoming a member of Touchstone Family of Climbing Gyms, I can say without a doubt there is a major difference between these two gyms in terms of climbing. The first and most obvious are the routes. PG is more technique based whereas M/C (Touchstone) is strength/endurance/technique based. Lead Climbing at M/C is harder because of the certification test and M/C tends to have fewer lead climbs rated below 10a. M/C is more of the serious climbing crowd where PG is more of the Marina/Climbing is hip for the moment crowd. Overall, you would not be wasting your money at PG.", "date": "2/4/2010"}

The climbs are varied enough that someone at any skill level will be able to find routes they like and the routes are updated frequently enough (every few months) so that you don't get too bored with them. The staff is knowledgeable and for the most part friendly and helpful though there is one guy there who seems to have an attitude. They do rent equipment (harness and shoes) for $6 but anyone with some basic math skills will quickly figure out its much cheaper to buy your own equipment if you plan on climbing with any regularity. The locker rooms are clean with towel service and sauna and don't have a gross factor ie these are not the type of locker rooms that makes you want to change and run out as soon as possible. The Yoga studios are also nice and surprisingly large.Also, PG is pretty new and clean and has great views. I really have no idea how I've lived in SF for years and am only just now learning about rock \u00a0climbing at PG, but I'm glad that I finally found this place.The Bad: Location. Yes, the view is great but PG is way out of the way past Crissy Field and it is hard to get to PG without a car. Yes it is doable, but it will take about an hour on muni from most places in the city. A better option might be to bike in or better yet get a ride with someone who has a car. Despite being hard to get to, it can also get pretty crowded at peak times ( 7ish weekdays) I've seen the wait be three people deep for certain climbs. This might be a minor complaint PG and I know it's pretty standard practice at a lot of places, but if we're already paying $70 a month do you really need to charge us a dollar to borrow a yoga mat? There can also be a lot of children here, which isn't such a bad thing except that every once in a while one of them will go running off like a stray missile and accidentally run into someone - parents keep an eye on your kids please. It's for everyone's safety. For beginners they do offer a beginning rock climbing class but unless you are completely new to climbing and can't even climb a ladder it will be a waste of money. Maybe I was with the wrong instructor but no one in our group got any specific individual advice and instead got generic beginner climbing tips that are easily found on line. To be fair, if asked a question the instructor would answer it, but sometimes you don't know the right question to ask and how are you supposed to know if you are doing anything wrong or if there is a better way to climb if you never get any individual feedback? You really don't need to pay $130 to be told that you should try and keep your weight balanced. Skip the BRC, join for a month and climb with someone with even a little experience - you'll end up knowing just as much and save yourself $60.The Ugly: There is no getting around the fact that climbing is a two person sport. Unfortunately PG doesn't do much of anything to help foster a community feeling for single climbers. The staff will make a general announcement on the speakers for others looking for a partner but if no one comes to the front you're SOL. It would be nice if PG did something to try and match up people other then simply referring them to the internet and telling you to come with a partner next time. Also, skip the BRC it's a rip off.", "date": "10/9/2009"}

Great ventilation and didnt get stuffy at all inside.The walls themselves were a lot of fun. I climbed mostly 5.8s and tried a few 5.9s. The paths ranged within themselves I thought--I was able to finish some 5.9s but not some 5.8s.

They also have the vertical cracks for climbers--I've seen professionals climb them in the natural environment, but I dont know what it's called. The bouldering was cool too, though I didnt try. The one in the middle on the first floor allow the user to get up on top and come back down through the path that says \"one way.\" There was also a second floor of bouldering.The gym was pretty good, though there's not a lot of space for floor routines. There's a long rod for pull ups, which makes sense for a climbing gym.As for pricing, renting shoes and harness was $6. I'm not sure about entry fee because I went with three guys who were all buying membership, so my entry got waived? I think it is usually about $20. Membership is about $70. The dressing room facility was amazing too--equipped with showers, lockers, hair dryers, hair straighteners and comb/brushes! I would definitely go back and sprawl across Crissy Fields afterward.

The routes are marked by the color of the hold, not with tape underneath. Sounds cool at first until there's a green route, white route, aquamarine route, and blue route -- and you're climbing the blue route. And then realize that the aquamarine route is also part of your route. Maybe it just takes some getting used to, but when I'm giving all my effort to climbing and clinging to the wall, I don't want to have to think twice about whether a hold is on: I want to look once and immediately know.Second complaint is that their location is so inaccessible. Bus routes there aren't convenient, parking isn't convenient, and it's far enough away to discourage me from biking.It's great for a big group on a week night though!

It was a madhouse but I won't hold that against them. I think the staff did a great job of handling the chaos.Cool things:  Everything was free today. Belay class, equipment, and day pass. Permanent belay cards. Once you pass the test you get a laminated card whether you're a member or not.  Routes are color coded by the holds and not tape. This makes it easier to see what is fair game so you're \u00a0less likely to cheat, unlike taped routes where you can't see what color a foothold is below you sometimes.  Walls are fairly uncluttered as far as routes go. Large bouldering area with lots of routes. Some I thought were mislabeled though. Isn't a V0 supposed to \u00a0be easy? If you need a belay partner, they announce it over the loudspeaker. That way you could potentially go \u00a0alone and still get to climb. Good for me since I have no friends in S.F. that climb except my sister.Not so cool things:   Walls are stucco but are still sandy. This means that scraping your foot on them will cause sand to rub off \u00a0and then fall onto holds below. It's also pretty abrasive. Holds also grind down the sandy surface then \u00a0loosen easily. For a brand new place I saw too many spinning holds. I was messaged by one of the construction crew that they spent many hours grinding down the surface to reduce the sand and that after a few months of use it shouldn't be a problem. Janky harnesses. They seemed cheap and scary. I have my own so it wasn't a problem though. Overall there seemed to be a lot of routes, the majority of which were 5.10's. I saw one 5.2, one 5.3, and one 5.4. Good for kids and warming up but it was tough with forty-twelve little kids running around in there today. A fair amount of lead climbing routes that looked challenging but the overall height of the facility was shorter than Mission Cliffs. Not necessarily a bad thing since the number of routes and difficulty kind of made up for it. I only had time today to climb a 5.9 but I think it was too easy. Maybe mislabeled and like I said, too many loose holds.Also they use a Grigri belay device and twist-lock carabiners that are already attached to the top ropes. You don't need to bring your own. I had only used ATC's and Super 8's before but the belay test girl was nice enough to show me how it worked. Just so you know, they require you tie a double fisherman's safety knot above your double-8.I'm only in S.F. on the weekends so I'm not sure if it would be worth it to become a member. The prices are on par with other climbing places and day passes or ten-trip passes would be best for me. Pretty cool place and maybe when the crowds go away it will be peaceful enough to enjoy a day of climbing.", "date": "9/14/2008"}

Its so much better than a standard gym since you get to look out at the beautiful view of the bay and the bridge. After a solid workout, it was time to hit the sauna! It felt so nice in there I fell asleep! The entire facility is super clean and the staff are all super friendly. This is an awesome find!", "date": "1/23/2009"}

Very chill crowd. Various ages as well. Saturdays and Sundays can get a little crowded with little ones (kid birthdays), but the staff is good about maintaining an adult climbing environment while allowing kids to try climbing and bouldering. The only crappy part: parking. But, then again, you're in SF. At least they have a free parking lot, right? Careful, and don't make up any spots as Presidio Police will absolutely ticket.

We did our climbing mainly around 7am and we had the whole wall to ourselves. No joke. Guess climbers are busy practicing their knots that early in the morning--who knows, but we loved it. Blisters galore but you just get used to it. And they have bottomless tape and bandaids to repair blisters to your heart's content. The Cross Fit gym in itself is worth the money. They have everything to really get after it. Might have to put that on as one of our challenges coming up here pretty soon.

Except this place also has like an acre of climbing walls and springy floors and mats where you can indulge your urges to scramble over rocks and scale obstacles to illogical heights. There really are few better workouts than climbing. You'll exercise your entire body and burn calories to boot. I went here during the grand opening when they gave away a day of free climbing to everyone who walked through the door. The staff was super friendly and worked quite efficiently -- they even offered belaying lessons to help you gain certification. Also have a nice climbing rope, a tight rope of sorts (?) and lots o gear should you decide to invest in your own ropes, shoes and harness. The climbing routes are exciting and challenging; clearly someone put some good thought into the wall design. Nice foot- and fingercracks running up the walls and plenty of overhangs to make your ascent more interesting.The space is carved out of an old warehouse it seems, and the huge windows offer plenty of natural light and incomparable views of Crissy Field, the Bay, downtown beyond, and Marin across the water. Unlike lots of gyms where everyone's just mindlessly trotting away on treadmills or trying to bench 200 lbs. for no good reason at all, everyone at Planet Granite carries a fun, care-free energy. As in, Hey, I actually LIKE going to my gym. It's as much play as it is a workout. Strongly considering abandoning my current gym in favor of Planet Granite.

Here's my reasoning. First off, Price, it is SO MUCH CHEAPER! Ok I'm a student, so I get the student discount and only pay $53 a month compared to MC's $67 membership (no student discount available). Otherwise I believe PG charges $70/month. Also, the initiation fee is cheaper too. MC charges $100, but $50 for students, where at Planet granites it's a $35 flat fee. I don't know how to belay yet and am not that great of a climber, YET! But at P.G they are very particular on who gets approved to belay. they don't take it as seriously at MCs. At P.G. you can only have 4 people max in a belay lesson which is $34. But if you buy a membership, they waive the fee. Afterwards you have to pass a test before they let you belay. If you don't learn how to accurately belay you could kill someone if you aren't paying attention when they're climbing. And they basically just give out belay cards at MC's! Another plus with PG is that they have a starter pack for beginners. For $130 after tax you can get shoes, harness and a chalk bag! Not too shabby! I'll be buying that deal! You can't find a better deal online, this shit is expensive! Sure some may think that it's too expensive to just rock climb. Well your membership also gets you free access to their gym exercise equipment! AND to their Yoga classes!!! What a steal! It is the same at MC's. Access to yoga classes and exercise equipment. Either way, for me, both are real hard to get to. I live on Fillmore and I'd have to hop 2 buses to get to either one. But PG has parking!!!!! MC is all street parking.", "date": "2/8/2010"}

When I saw a Groupon on offer for an intro climbing package for 2, I had to have it. My boyfriend was in town this weekend and we have been looking for more fun activities to do together when he is visiting, so we made reservations for the 10 am class on Sunday. The gym was pretty empty when we arrived and seemed cavernous. I kept looking around in awe - there were so many walls and routes! The views are amazing, even on a slightly foggy morning. The huge windows look out over the water and the Golden Gate Bridge, with the wide expanse of Crissy Field to the right. Apparently they roll up the windows on a fine day, awesome. The other awesome thing is that there is a sauna (!) in the ladies' locker room and everything looked very clean. There were only four of us in this particular class which was great. Our instructor Colin was super friendly and positive, and spent an equal amount of time with each of us. He was very helpful in refreshing my memory on belay techniques. I got a little twisty trying to tie my fisherman knot after the figure-8, but he was so patient with me and showed me the right way. After about 40 minutes of teaching and practice time, we were ready to get our temporary belay passes (which were good for the whole day). There looked to be many different skill level climbs and they were all marked by color - it was cool to look up overhead and try to follow the various routes. Not that I'll ever get to that point but it was neat to visualize. We spent over an hour climbing, mostly the 5.4-5.6 climbs which seemed to fit our skill level just fine. Some of the walls do seem higher than others and I had a few tricky spots around the ledges that poke out from the wall, but I wasn't scared of heights or safety or anything. We finished up exhausted and sweaty but also energized. I am actually not as sore today as I thought I would be, especially for having taken a TRX class the day before.If you take the introductory lesson like we did, they throw a few \u00a0discounts at you, including a 5-pk of day passes and a discounted beginner rock-climbing course. The caveat though is that you have to sign up for it that day and the passes expire two months from date of purchase :( My boyfriend won't be back until the end of August and there's no way I'll make it back here by myself since I'm such a procrastinator. Planet Granite provides a really great opportunity for beginning climbers, though - I'm hooked! I would definitely like to return. I do take the bus though, and it's a good half-hour walk from the last 30 stop in the Marina to get here. It's certainly a scenic walk but damn, talk about a workout before your workout! And the walk back to the bus stop after climbing was hell, especially since I had forgotten my damn sunglasses and the morning fog had of course lifted. That's my one complaint about this place - if they opened a Planet Granite on the Embarcadero I would be all over it.", "date": "7/11/2011"}

There are a bunch of other knit-picky things I could say but you get the picture, not a great gym. \u00a0You wouldn't join this as your weight lifting gym. \u00a0you would join if you \u00a0like to climb and take yoga classes. \u00a0Some of the stretching things and balls are near the weight level downstairs, some are way up at this little stretching area at the highest level. \u00a0It's not set up by people who lift weights/cross train. \u00a0Neither is any \"theme gym\" in this city. \u00a0.ugh! \u00a0*there's Crossfit, but it's over $100 EXTRA a month. \u00a0The regular membership is around $70/month already. \u00a0Not really a deal. \u00a0(Go to Krav Maga if you want Crossfit included in the gym price, as I recently found out.)*Every time I go with my friend there is no parking. \u00a0Tourists use their parking lot, and we just circle and circle the parking lot. \u00a0There isn't street parking at Crissy Field there either.", "date": "4/27/2010"}

But, if I can't get to Yosemite, climbing in the Presidio by the seaside is the next best thing... follow up with a little kite surf on the bay.There's a 5.13 finger crack that has yet to see a first ascent. Would love to have my name on it but I doubt that's realistic. Whoever built this gym was having fun, and it all promises years of fun / great training for us... For the true trad climber, there are a few *adjustable* cracks, pretty impressive, so the indoor crack climbing experience doesn't get old.Best of all are the spaces... stretching on the old crane deck with a birds-eye view of the gym and great views of the valley, space to kick it by the upstairs bouldering, lounging between sessions, and what an epic steep boulder up to that second floor, reminiscent of 'Ghetto Simulator' at Hueco with ~ 35' of severely overhanging bouldering, never higher off the ground than just dropping your feet. Sweet. Well composed, good for fun. Lots of *steep* bouldering.I've been a member for a long time.

Having the voice of God scare the shit out of you in the middle of a climb isn't very conducive to technique- They have a \"policy\" that you can't teach new climbers how to belay. Apparently, it's a liability issue with them (and nowhere else) but it doesn't really make sense as they test everyone who comes in anyway. We were told by one employee when we came in that we could teach our newbie friend, and were later chewed out about it by another. He told us that the only way a new climber could be taught to belay would be through a $35 belay course. Of course, we were told this after we had bought our day passes and rented all our gear. Sounds like a money-milking policy to me. A couple other workers even later admitted that that was the first time they had heard about such policy.Overall decent gym and friendly staff, aside from the one ass-clown employee.", "date": "9/18/2008"}

For us vertically challenged beings it is a big plus to have substantial space for all the wall hungry climbers. There are plenty of routes to choose from, as well as varying wall heights for those who prefer longer or shorter pitches. Routes range in difficulty from 5.2 to 5.14.The Good:It's huge!Many routes to choose from.Both bouldering routes and wall routes.Fantastic fitness gym facility. They re-route portions of the climbing gym every month or so.Well maintained. Locker rooms are clean, with plenty of lockers. Great location! After you're done climbing or yoga-ing, Crissy field is right outside for a quick run or picnic. The So-So:Living north of the bridge, traffic can be horrendous.

I grew up climbing indoors and outdoors in Boulder but got out of it when I went to college and then started my career. I've been wanting to get back into it, so I decided to take a refresher belay course at PG. The first thing I noticed when i walked in to the gym was how low the ceilings were for a rock gym, and subsequently, how short the courses were. For $32 you get a 1-2 hour (depending on class size and instructor style) course on the basics of top roping, equipment rental and a day pass. Apparently classes are normally kept to 4 students, but my class had an extra thrown in. The female instructor (I won't name names) didn't seem to take her job as seriously as I had hoped. She was often looking out into the rest of the gym or not even really paying attention at all when people were asking questions and asking her to double check they had done their knots correctly. But, I'm sure it didn't help her out that the class was made of several incompetent types. When it was time to take turns climbing and belaying with each other, I was sure to team up with the person in my class that seemed to know what was going on. Unfortunately, when I was 2/3 up the wall the instructor was screaming at me to stop climbing because my belayer kept taking her break hand off the rope. It's always great to hear news like that when you're 40 feet up in the air. Luckily the view of the bay and Crissy Field was breathtaking, so I took a few minutes to take that in while the clusterf*** below me was figured out. You have to wait at least 24 hours before you try to test out, but they do give you a nice coupon for half off a day pass the next time you come. My class ran over and I ended up missing my Meetup group, so not having anyone to top rope with, I spent the rest of the afternoon bouldering. The bouldering courses are quite possibly the only feature PG has over the gyms I used to go to in Colorado. There is a huge selection of different courses and varied levels of difficulty. The 'topping out' was something new to me, and gives you a bigger sense of accomplishment when you get to pull yourself up to the top and then walk down the stairs (although in my opinion, coming down is also a valuable skill). Certain areas of the bouldering section were dangerously crowded, and I was waiting for someone to jump down on or fall on someone else. There were a lot of experienced and impressive climbers at PG, but there were also a lot of amateurs who were behaving in ways that could potentially injure other climbers. I never once saw PG staff on the floor monitoring climbers. They all seemed to be huddled around the front desk, or leading one of the annoying birthday party groups.The two worst things about PG are the unsafe atmosphere and the hoopty courses on the top rope walls and the two best things are the large bouldering area and the amazing views of Crissy and the bay. I will most likely be back at PG at some time or another, but only after I check out Mission Cliffs.", "date": "3/1/2009"}

I'm a rather shy person and have been curious about rock climbing for awhile. I finally got up the gumption to call and ask about the Beginning Rock Climbing class, and after chatting with a very helpful and friendly staffer on the phone, signed up for class that week. After 4 weeks of the BRC with Lindsay, I felt strong enough and confident enough to top rope and boulder, and got my belay card (proves you've passed the belay test and can belay without supervision) within the first week. I made some new friends in the BRC class and fell in love with bouldering, mostly because I don't need to go looking for a partner if I want to go rock climbing. So I joined the gym by the end of my 4 week class. I bought some great shoes from PG and have been going regularly if not religiously. Not only do I love the workout and strength I feel from rock climbing at PG, but the staff and members are some of the friendliest, nicest, non-intimidating people I have ever met. The energy and vibe of the gym is fantastic, whether it's a quiet time like midday during the week, or a busy time like the weekends and evenings. I dig their DJ. The routes and problems truly fit the posted difficulty level. You can always find something fun and challenging without being frustratingly difficult. They have a good number of route designers who change up the various problems every couple or few months, so there's always something new and interesting to work on. And, who wouldn't want to climb in a gym with this amazing view?! Planet Granite is fun and friendly. I recommend it to anyone interested in rock climbing.", "date": "9/22/2010"}
