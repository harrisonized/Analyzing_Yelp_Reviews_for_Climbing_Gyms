The groupon includes rental gear and a day pass to the climbing gym. They were very accommodating by adding both me and my girlfriend into the next class even though there was only one spot available. Our instructor (I forgot his name) was very knowledgeable and skilled at teaching our beginner's class where everyone had different levels of climbing. He was patient and made sure each of us tied our ropes correctly and got a chance to do a trial climb up the walls. He also made it fun by cracking jokes here and there while quizzing us to make sure we understood the important steps of belaying.After the class, we were free to roam around the facilities and try the different levels of wall climbing. It's very fun and a great way to work out your arms without lifting weights. After awhile, my arms started to feel like jello from lifting my body up from each reach and it felt extremely sore the next day. I saw people from different ages and families here enjoying wall climbing while the environment was very friendly. I'd highly recommend Sender One for indoor climbing, even if you're a beginner because (let's face it) the majority of people are.To save you time, make sure you sign the waiver online beforehand.", "date": "1/7/2019"}

There was a really nice cave section in the middle of the gym where you can top out at which I love to do because on outdoor boulders you would normally top out anyways. My only issue with the gym is that the hold are kind of dirty. I might be spoil at my home gym but I feel like the hand holds are either too slick or has a lot of shoe rubber on them.

The boyfriend knew that I wanted to climb for a while, so he got me a Groupon deal to learn how to top rope belay in addition to a 5 punch card pass. Rentals (harness, shoes, chalk bag) are included in the pass, which is very nice. The belay class was very easy to follow and we flew through it with flying colors. There are four checks as a climber and a belayer (the person at the bottom making sure the climber does not fall). I felt very safe while climbing. You receive a temporary pass when you complete the training, and can climb the rest of the day. You will need to pass a test when you come back the next time to climb, so I suggest that you write down what you learn and review tying knots before you take the test. There are many routes set up in the gym with varying levels and heights. There are many routes available even when the gym seems crowded. I like that the holds are color coordinated and routes have a laminated card that specify if the route is top rope and/or lead. The dome is beautiful and makes the gyms gorgeous. Sender One also has a bouldering section, but the gym is mainly for top rope and lead rope belay. I believe they also offer Aerial silk and yoga classes. What I hate is that top rope requires two people.

The place does get packed up, but everyone seems very respectful of others space.Overall I'd give this place a solid 4.5/5 stars for the safe and solid training they provide.

The staff here really seem to have a love for this place and genuinely want everyone to be the best climbers they can.*Facility - it was really clean here. From my first impression of the place, I can tell everyone really cares for this place. I guess they have to since membership is really expensive.*Equipment - I can comment too much on the walls, but the general consensus is that it's much higher than most local facilities.Anecdote: this was only my second time rock climbing ever. My friend signed me up for a class. Emily was my instructor; she was patient and thorough. She did a good job with building my confidence since I have a mad fear of heights and falling.You truly get what you pay for when you come here. I liked it so much that I purchased a 5-punch pass which costs $69. One negative, but minor, aspect I would like to point out is that it is not very beginner friendly.

I'm getting too old for this) There's a decent sized bouldering area with a wide range of walls. Ya got the vertical walls, ya got the overhung walls, ya got the ROOF. It's great. I spend most of my time bouldering here and they reset the problems pretty often which is nice. Sometimes they set the problems a little soft, but usually it's pretty consistent. In the back, it's this behemoth rope climbing area. Seriously, it's very impressive. The walls are all very aesthetically pleasing also. There's a giant bulbous wall that is lead only, but it's so freaking cool. The walls are REALLY tall here. The staff is super friendly and there's tons of community events! Love it! Day passes run ~$24 last time I checked. But I ended up buying like a discount card, can't remember what it's called. But you pay for the card and then every day pass after that is 30% off or something. It ends up being like $16 for a day pass instead of $24, which is great if you don't go enough to warrant a monthly membership.I LOVE THIS PLACE.

(see that review for that fun story). The change routes what seems like almost daily (they have full time staff who just set routes) if I could drop a few suggestions in the \"suggestion box.\" 1.) there is a bouldering difficulty level below a V0 (~5.9) called a VB(5.5-5.8) this would be better for distinguishing the \"children\" bouldering routes and training routes. Many new boulders assume all the V0 routes are kid routes, so they avoid them and the V1 routes can be very difficult for new climbers. So using the V0 for actual \"routes\" and the VB for kid climbs would be useful and help the ego of beginner climbers so they don't think they are climbing kid routes lol2.) can we please please please get an easier route in the cave (maybe like a V2 or V3). I think the easiest is a single V4 under there and the rest are all really advanced. I wanna feel like one of the advanced climbers and start practicing full inverted climbs too! 3.) Ban all children from now until the end of time. I won't be mad if only 2 of the 3 suggestions are met :-P But seriously, you guys rock. I was only being half serious.

I've been to a few rock gyms, including some bouldering only, and have been climbing outside many times. Sender One is a one-of-a-kind gym. Most gyms try and replicate the ambience of an outdoor climbing setting, but Sender One's founder, Chris Sharma, knew that indoor climbing would never be the same as the outdoors, and so he set out to create a completely unique setting. Sender One's walls not only are made up of cool funky colors, but have a great texture, unlike the wood walls of other gyms. Sender also has some of California's best route setters, who create new, challenging problems every week! One downside of Sender is that its bouldering area is slightly smaller than I'd like, but its awesome top-rope and lead climbing sections more than make up for it, with 50 foot high walls and great arches and overhanging sections. There's even a small traditional gym and yoga studio within the larger complex. If you haven't been to Sender, I'd highly recommend checking it out.

LAX location has bigger bouldering walls and therefore better boulder problems . And in my opinion more bouldering routes and they seem to change the routes more often. \u00a0 \u00a02. The separated fitness area in another building at Santa Ana , despite bigger , means I have to check in 2-3 times sometimes, not a big deal but one of the reasons. 3. LAX has free towel for shower and sauna , Santa Ana has neither. 4. LAX has moonboard and separate hangboard areas, which is super nice . \u00a0 \u00a0Unfortunately, due to the traffic and my location, I have to go to Santa Ana location 80% of the time . \u00a0I wish Santa Ana location is more like LAX location is all I'm saying. \u00a0Of course if you have a rope climbing partner all the time , the Santa Ana location might be not be as bad .", "date": "7/18/2018"}

Their walls have assigned numbers that represent difficulty level rather than tagging (I obviously started at 0 which was still kinda difficult haha).Their tallest wall is 50ft so you can imagine how open the space is! They have areas with shelves where you can leave your stuff and sit.I also took a Yoga class held in the back room which was really lovely-the instructor gave us a quick oil massage on our forehead at the end of class which was divine~The people there were just so great! I left my belongings to the side and didn't worry about anybody stealing them.

In the class, they give you a tour of the gym, and then they teach you basic roping techniques to tie knots and do some belaying to start top roping with your friend. After the class, you do have the day pass for the day so can continue climbing with your friend all over the gym. At this point, you generally have access to the top roping portions, and the bouldering portions, though they don't actually boulder with you during the class.After this introduction, we were given the option to get 5 day passes for $60 with rentals, which my friend and I ended put taking seeing as it was only $12/day with rentals. We are currently about halfway through the punch pass, and I will likely sign up for the full membership, which they waive the initiation fee for if you purchased the 5 days punch pass.The gym is rather large, and there are quite a few sections to it, including the Sender City portion which is not included in regular membership/punch pass but has to be purchased separately. They have yoga classes, a small area with gym equipment, a bouldering section, a top roping section, a section to do lead climbing, and relatively clean restrooms. I enjoyed most of the bouldering and climbing routes I have tried so far, and because there is such a variety, it keeps me from getting bored each time I go. As I get better I get to jump to the next level/grade up and enjoy another selection of climbs and routes.The people I have met at the gym have all been pretty friendly and cool, and the gym itself does seem to have a variety of events going on all the time, though I haven't really gone to any myself.", "date": "4/15/2016"}

There's routes that range from beginner to elite. There's several bouldering areas, including a cave and one that you can top out on. The top rope walls range from 30 to 50 feet and have all different levels of difficulties (although I think Sender is a bit generous with their route grading) and layouts. These routes can be ascended via lead climbing as well, and there's routes specifically designed only for lead. The routes are reset pretty often to keep things fresh and to motivate you to finish them before they're gone for good. There's also a speed route wall and a couple areas designed for crack climbing. Finger boards are offered in another area for you to work on that all important grip strength. Whatever your climbing preference is, this place has it.All the holds are solid and well maintained for a facility as large as this. The floors are heavily padded so you can be a bit bolder when you attempt to complete your routes. There's couches for you to relax on while you ponder your next route, and there's plenty of cubbies for storage of your nonessential climbing gear. There's also a small gym area with some free weights and machines if you want a different kind of workout. Climbing and yoga classes are also offered.Pricing is reasonable for such a well maintained and equipped facility. $22 for a day pass, or $84 a month with an initiation fee. You can opt to get a yearly pass for $949 and save a couple dollars vs. the month to month option. Being a member allows you 1 guest per month as well, and you can attend the various classes that's offered for free or a small fee. You can also rent shoes, chalk and a harness, but if you go frequently, invest in your own gear. There's plenty of gear available for purchase by the front desk.They also hold events throughout the month to help to make new climbing buddies, especially if you like to top rope. This is especially useful because everyone who wants to belay has to be certified by Sender One for safety reasons. They also host national competitions and you can volunteer for free guest passes. There's a kid area, Funtopia, that can also double as a great corporate or group event area.This is an amazing place for anyone looking to get into the sport or just a fun night out doing something active and different.", "date": "1/5/2017"}

Because they really utilized the space efficiently, there are climbs that are too near each other, so one's descent could easily interfere with another's ascent if not cautious.

Whether you're learning to climb (relearning, in my case), or you're so jacked that you are more likely to rip the holds out of the wall before you let go, this is where it's at. Don't believe me? Go try it. Head over to the boulders by yourself and tell me how many minutes it is before some stranger is encouraging you on the wall, helping you out while you stare puzzled at the route, or congratulating you when you finally send it.", "date": "8/8/2016"}

This place is so new and has already built such a great reputation for itself.FACILITYThe walls are brightly colored with a 'space' design and some back lighting. The holds themselves are also brightly colored and contrast with the walls so the routes are super clear and obvious if you're previewing the route. Aesthetically, this gym is the most beautifully designed gym I've been to. They change the routes every 6-8 weeks! Almost all the floors in the climbing area is padded so you don't have to worry about falling or landing on hard ground. They even have some couches to chill on when you're resting or creeping on other climbers lol. Grigri are attached to every top rope so no need to worry about borrowing belay devices (unless you're leading). This also means that there are no anchors in the ground. Everything has been thought out so well! There's even an area for teaching newbies how to belay, so they don't have to use the actual walls and taking up a rope.  The kids' area, Funtopia, looks pretty awesome as well, but I have yet to check it out. It's an additional fee, even if you're a member, but if you check in on Yelp you can get $5 off Funtopia admission ;) There's a small weight room with free weights and machines so you don't even need a regular gym membership anymore! They have yoga classes daily as well, but the room is pretty small and classes fill up quickly so you have to get there early. The last time I tried going to a yoga class, the floor was covered with mats wall-to-wall. Very clean bathrooms with lockers and showers.PRICING The day pass is $20/day with $6 rentals. If you've never climbed before, I suggest taking the Intro to Climbing class for $30 which includes the class, day pass, and rentals.Membership is a bit steep at $75/month + $100 initiation fee, but there are deals all the time. We were able to get a 'Back to School' membership special which waived the initiation fee. They have punch cards as well which is worth it if you anticipate going a couple of times a month, but not as much as 3x a week. Membership includes 1 free guest pass per month which is nice. Your guest will get a free day pass, free rentals, and a free Intro to Climbing class. There are also lots of events that S1 holds that are either free or discounted for members as well.EVENTSI love that S1 holds awesome events every month! From competitions to meet ups to free guest day, the membership definitely doesn't skimp on perks.OVERALLFrom avid climbers to beginners just starting out, I recommend this gym to everyone. The price is a bit steep for just a day pass, so I suggest going when they have special promo discounts or as a guest of a member.", "date": "11/21/2014"}

We also had to sign our lives away on a few waiver forms, which you should do BEFORE you get there because it saves you time. They provide you with shoes, chalk bags, and harnesses, but bring a pair of good, thick pair of socks and for the gals, wear tight fitting exercise/yoga pants. Our instructor, Chris, was awesome! He started on time and explained everything clearly. He taught us about the equipment and how to wear our harnesses properly. When we got to the knot tying, he taught us how to remember the knots (the ol' choke and poke) and how to know if we'd done it correctly as well as correct climbing etiquette and safety. The belaying portion was easier, but probably the most important in terms of safety. When we finally got to the wall, the first thing we did was climb up it and fall. Once we were done we got to climb pretty much whatever we wanted and for the entire rest of the day, which I was not aware of. It's a great workout activity if you're looking for something new, need to entertain some kids, or looking for a new exercise regimen. I highly recommend getting the Groupon, it's $15-16/person and you get to use their equipment and facility for the rest of the day after you've finished the 1 hour intro session for nothing extra.

I used to have an obssession with fitness and maintaining my physique, but that went out the door once the hard college classes came about. Sender One is my non-living symbol of motivation to get back into shape, and I'm obsessed. There are two main factors that I feel motivated by this place: the atmosphere and amenities. The instructors and staff provide you with the knowledge necessary in order to succeed your climbing goals. It's a learning process and you can see improvements in your technique with each visit. As a beginner, you can start off by learning to belay with one of the instructors. They teach you how to tie a Figure-8 Loop Knot as well as a Fisherman's knot on your belaying ropes. It gives you the feeling of being a true boyscout without all the homophobia. The next step is then learning how to properly provide tension to the climber and techniques to foster safety. The lesson is guided throughly which provides any novice ample time to practice and master the techniques. The staff are friendly and willing to guide your ultimate improvement in climbing. In regards to the amenities, there are two main sections that I classify. The bouldering and belaying sections. Each region is marked by difficulty cards raging from 0 - 12 (I think). This classification allows the member to mark their progress from the day they start. Each route is changed constantly to provide new challenges for the member to accomplish. There is also an indoor gym with cardio and weightlifting equipments to further enoucrage your goals of achieving physical fitness.OVERALL, Sender One is an inspiring place to work out at. The environment does not discourage, and there is a sense of community that comes with climbing. Support is one thing that does not lack within this gym.", "date": "3/27/2016"}

It was both of our first times and the class you take to learn how to tie the ropes and how to depend on your partner is really helpful. Our instructor was very nice and had lots of patients. After you get that down, you're free to climb the walls. We climbed but since we were beginners we didn't get that far up on the levels. The ones we did do, we made it to the top. Super fun activity for you and your family. People of all ages were in there. I would totally come back.", "date": "6/22/2016"}

With over two stories high, its no wonder that the people here take safety extremely seriously. They go the extra measure to ensure that you know how to belay and test your skill when you come in. If you pass, you will get a belay certification card that you have to wear so the staff knows you know what youre doing. Most rock climbing gyms don't have the second knot on top of the first main knot but this one teaches you the safety knot just in case the first one fails. The gym itself is beautiful with numerous walls for bouldering, rock climbing, and lead climbing. There's walls that slant out, walls that overhang, walls above you, and cracks that you can work with while climbing. The color and design of the wall is also very beautiful. With AC at this gym, you will never smell the other people sweating around you. There's also a second floor that you can climb on and watch everyone or use the running machine, or theres also a seating area on the bottom floor in the middle of the wall where you can relax and chill. On top of the bouldering and rock climbing aspect, there is also a regular gym with a good amount of equipment and yoga room that you can utilize as part of your pass. Classes are held on every day except Friday, so catch it if you can!Although this gym is a bit more pricey, it is definitely worth it. I make the drive down from LA county to Santa Ana just for this gym.. as the other gyms cannot even compare. The equipment is newer, chalk bags are provided, AC, giant walls with a wide variety, top notch safety checks, and even staff walking around to make sure everything is safe. There's even a Funtopia where you can do challenge courses and play with the velcro wall and other fun stuff. Too bad you can't walk in anymore, as it gets booked in one hour slots very quickly. Best gym in socal forsure. The only downside- no more student discounts... us broke college students tho :( At $26 for a day pass and rentals.. it could definitely add up especially if you don't have a membership pass. Wish I lived closer to the OC so I could come here more often.", "date": "12/1/2014"}

I signed up for the 6 pm class where they teach you the basics, like how to put on your harness, how to tie some knots, and how to belay. I showed up 15 mins before class so I could try on rock climbing shoes, which I have no clue how the sizing works - took me 3 tries to get it right. Not really comfy, and not really meant to be comfy. *imagine ballet shoes* The crew was young, super energetic and friendly. They greeted me just as I entere the door. If you plan to take the class, I recommend signing the waiver online, it will save you time when you check-in. The class was great, our instructor was easy to understand and he was responsive to anyone that needed assistance. Our class was small, just 5 of us so it was easy to learn. He explained it, demonstrated it, let us try it, and he did some one-on-one with each of us. Then we took turns climbing and belaying. It was a lot of fun. The class was supposed to be an hour long but we finished early and had the rest of the night to enjoy. The facility is fairly big and it was busy, it was Pride Night and there was a potluck! PIZZA! It was pretty warm in there with all the people. I walked around, watched some crazy amazing rock climbs and did some bouldering. My arms hurt now. Oh and I guess it's dog friendly, a guy took his 2 puppies inside. There were a lot of people just sitting around resting which is a great opportunity to just people watch. I hope they expand over to IE", "date": "6/29/2016"}

In this way, the beginners aren't just stuck to one side of the wall or the more advanced stuck to one side of the wall.So our first day there started off with introduction to wall climbing and basic techniques you need to learn and master so you don't die while climbing. \u00a0On Belay, belay on, climbing, tension, tying knots, and putting on the harness correctly will save you and your partners' life, if you want. \u00a0Our trainer was really good on explaining how to tie the tricky knotts and afterwards gave us a temporary card that says we were knowledgeable enough to climb. \u00a0The next time that we come back, we will be retested on the climber and the belayer for a permanent card that we needed to attach visibly at all times. \u00a0I've been here twice now and so far it's been really fun. \u00a0I like how they're really into safety and won't let you climb unless you've been tested. \u00a0The only weird part I don't like is if you FAIL the test, you aren't allowed to take it till the next day. \u00a0That sucks because I was there with my brother and he failed while I passed. \u00a0He was allowed to climb, but not to belay (be the person on bottom). \u00a0Luckily, the tester allowed him a temporary so that I too can climb while he belays.I really like this facility as it is very well kept and clean. \u00a0There are restrooms near the lobby with full showers, lockers, and restrooms. \u00a0They also sell bananas for the monkey's and coffee just in case you need an afternoon pick me upI also want to mention this place has a Funtopia section for kids, basically an overgrown jungle gym. \u00a0Then there's also a small gym and yoga classes available daily. \u00a0Love to join and be a full member once my groupon expires, but unfortunately I won't have a climbing buddy to go with =(", "date": "7/28/2014"}

To climb and live life with abandon. Gone are those days for me and probably for most people when they come here they don't feel nostalgia like I do. That's because most didn't climb every moment they could, work and sleep at a climbing gym and fully immerse themselves in the subculture that was the climbing community. A tendon injury forcibly removed me from it. Being years removed from that life has taught me many things, but my first thought was \"wow\". The notables. It's huge. Like 3 times the size of my old gym and taller. Top out boulder, hi tech walls, brand new holds, top notch setters, tons of staff, lessons on the hour. Expensive. Everyone is so young here. Still very bro-centric being in Orange County, it's much less dirty bag climbing life. Hi tech logins, finger print scanning, it's more than a climbing gym, they've got Yoga, showers,etc.My climbing journey started in my early 20's where I went from bouldering to setting, to sport climbing to trad, rescue and onto free soloing. It was about the outdoor experience. Now people use the gym to stay strong for outside, not as a fall back to when they could not get outside. I've seen and done it all. The old saying \"gym make you strong like bull, dumb like wall\". Climbing colored and taped holds is one thing, but much less pure than climbing outside. Some cons are the ergo of it, doesn't flow, no traverse, no non climbing specific workout machines, way too much spray, like from everyone. Where I come from and from when I come from you climb, spray your beta somewhere else members because I may not have the strength and endurance I use to, but my technique is still above average and I still think like a climber, not a gym boulderer. It's poor form. There is a social aspect in the gym you can't get away from, but if I'm climbing 2's in the corner with my headphones on, don't bother me. Kids these days don't learn the etiquette of real climbing when they stay in their gym. Top ropes use gri gri's, both those and lead require separate certs, though I saw some pretty questionable technique from certified members and instructors teaching. Strong ties to local soler Evolv which is great.If your looking to get into climbing, come here because it's new, hi tech, modern and legit. If your looking to get into rock climbing you may needlessly be wasting quite a bit of money by getting your membership here.", "date": "12/26/2014"}

Sender One definitely satisfied those demands. The bouldering area had some really cool routes, and our yoga instructor, Rebecca, was super cool and led a great class. \u00a0My biggest issue with the bouldering area is the stiffness of the padding. Every other gym I've been to definitely has softer padding. In my opinion, that's very important because when you're training you want to be able to go all out on a move without having to think about how you're going to fall. You can definitely hurt yourself on their pads if you don't exercise a little discretion while you're climbing. Also, there seemed to be a little inconsistency with the route setting, but that will be the case anywhere. \u00a0Overall a cool place to workout, as they have everything you'd need if you're into climbing.

Take a lock with you so you can store your belongings in the locker room without being paranoid while climbing!! :) After storing my purse and wallet we were off to learn how to belay and tie knots. The training took about 45 minutes and it was only me and my boyfriend in the group so we were joking around with Hank (who was awesome!) a lot. Learning everything was actually super fun and interesting! There was a moment when I thought there was too much to handle and too much responsibility but after tackling all the knots by myself once I was super confident to climb and belay my partner. After passing the quizzes and going over everything we were ready to climb! First off, there are SOO many options here. You have courses for super advanced lead climbers, and ones for beginners. Some with round rocks with barely any grip and some with nice odd shaped rocks that were easy to grab. You can pick which course you want to tackle because they're labeled in numerical order based on difficulty. We stuck to courses 6-8. If you want to be really legit you're supposed to only use a certain color of rock on each climb that's labelled on the paper that marks the difficulty but I just grabbed anything and everything that helped me keep going up lol. Little disclaimer. Be prepared to have sore hands and sacrifice your manicure ladies. The hardest part for me was the fact that handling the rope so much makes your hands weak and thus makes it a bit painful when you're climbing. After climbing for 2.5 hours I literally fell off the last climb because my hands were too chapped and sore to pull myself up properly. (Falling was even fun here!) Overall this was a really fun use of time and I definitely want to come back. FYI I kind of misread the confirmation email which said, \"We offer water, snacks and bars, but feel free to bring your own\" and thought they provided water snacks and bars but you have to purchase them. They're prices were decent and it was no big deal but next time I'll bring my Camelbak for sure! Definitely try this out!", "date": "3/25/2014"}

I came here this past weekend on Saturday morning with a friend. She had been here before and recommended this place over another rock climbing facility in Huntington Beach. I had actually passed this place before many times while driving on the freeway and didn't even know it was a rock climbing facility. Upon entering you can either register through the iPads they have or at the front desk. The staff provides you with climbing shoes, harness and a bag of chalk. This was my first time rock climbing and at Sender One so I had to take a belay class.Our instructor Hank was such a cool guy, I thought it was going to be difficult learning how to tie the rope and safety points you have to follow but he made it so easy and fun for us to learn. He quizzed us after every lesson to make sure we absorbed everything otherwise he's not allowed to give us the belay card for the day. After passing his quiz and learning the basics we were ready to climb. It was harder than I thought it would be to climb, specially when you have long nails like I do. It seemed so easy but you need a lot of upper body strength, either way it was fun and a great experience. The staff is so friendly, knowledgable and always helpful. They walk around the facility in case you have any questions or need help. It has so many different walls with different difficulty levels, the highest walls are 50ft and the easiest climb is a 6. This facility is not only for rock climbing, it also has yoga classes, fitness section and a section for kids called Funtopia. Their bathroom lockers are very clean and in the women's bathroom they have a courtesy basket filled with hair bands in case you forgot one. If your a first timer you will be paying $30 but after that general day pass is $20. Awesome experience will definitely be back!", "date": "2/27/2014"}

We were greeted by the girl in the front desk with short hair, her name is Thais.

I didn't think any of it as my friend mentioned it will be $30 for our part of the Groupon and just thought it didn't include equipment rental.However, the next day my friend ask for our part of the deal and I was confused because we were charged up front. I called the store and they did confirm that we were there and part of Groupon as well as the fact that my boyfriend paid the charges. The person I spoke to directed me to their website to email their billing; with that said, I thought they're helpful. However, I later learned that on their receipt , Thais only charged us with the rental which cost $14 and not the day passes; my boyfriend suspected she had pocketed it since he paid cash. Days passed and I haven't heard from them so I called again last Friday 12/23 to check if they have received my email, they have not. And now they told me to email a different address from what was on their website. Granted it is the holidays but I find it very deceptive of what has been done.

They have a little locker room and plenty of storage space to stow your stuff. They even have a water fountain specially made for filling up water bottles. My only real complain is the price.

When I went to Sender One with my sisters, they revealed that bouldering was \"just like rock climbing\" but with one big difference--no harness! What?! Initially I was fearful about how I was going to rock climb without a harness, but then they explained that Sender One had padded floors and courses of varying levels so I felt (slightly) better. Once we went inside, I was impressed at how organized everything was. Even though it was Saturday afternoon, it wasn't too crowded so I quickly filled out an online waiver and then paid the day pass fee (around $24). Personally, I thought it was worth a lot for just one day, and I found out Rockreation in Costa Mesa was also $20 per day. At least the $24 included climbing all day, rental shoes and other facilities including their gym and yoga studio. They also give you chalk to help you grip the stones better. If you want to go rock climbing, you'll have to pay extra, but I didn't pursue this option.Bouldering turned out not to be as scary as I initially imagined. Yeah there's no harness, but the walls aren't so high that you'll get hurt if you jump off. Plus there are many rocks on the wall so it's easy to climb down if you feel tired or if your hands gets sweaty. The course levels are designed in two different categories. Essentially the higher the number of the course is, the more difficult it'll be. So Course #23 would be harder than #15. Also, they have courses that go by v0, v1, v2, v3, etc. Similarly, v3 is more difficult than v1. Since this was my first time ever bouldering, I was only able to do v0-v2 courses. Believe me though, you'll get an awesome arm, core and back muscle workout.After 2 hours of climbing, I reached a point where it was too difficult for me to climb anything. There were courses that I initially completed before that I couldn't do later because I was so exhausted. I definitely recommend bringing a bottle of water and snacks so that you can keep yourself energized while you go bouldering. My friends and I decided to check out the gym and yoga studio, and it was completely empty!! We had fun exercising with the pull up bars, monkey bars, bosu ball, and other equipment. Some of my friends also practiced their yoga moves in the yoga studio since no classes were going on. It was a great way to cool down after climbing. As a side note, if you're going to be renting shoes, wear socks that go above your ankles! After an hour or so, the shoes started rubbing against my ankles causing them to bleed :( I also got blisters too because my hands weren't accustomed to bouldering. Luckily the staff at Sender One were friendly enough to give me band-aids to help alleviate some of the pain. But if you decide to keep climbing even if you have blisters/cuts, you'll need to cover them with climbing tape because your sweat will cause the band-aids to come off. Yelp does have a special where you can get $5 off if you check in! Unfortunately I did not discover this until after I had paid =_=.", "date": "9/7/2014"}

I did the belay class with one of my friends. We have both rock climbed before but she had only used an auto belay device and needed to learn how to belay. It wasn't too bad considering for our class we also got free gear rental and free climbing for the rest of the day. Our instructor was really friendly and helped everyone memorize the safety points. The safety points for the belay test are also identical to the points for Planet Granite. He pointed out that some of the routes might be similar in style to Planet Granite locations in NorCal because the setter use to set the routes at PG.The facility is HUGE! It's a great place to throw a kids party they have an area called \"funtopia\" with options for team building and for children's birthday parties. The top rope area is at least twice the size of PG Belmont. The walls vary in height, on the left side it reaches 35 ft while the highest wall reaches 50 ft. There are comfy chairs to lounge in near the center so when you get tired you can rest and watch other people climb.

It's a spacious place with a good range of routes for bouldering and top roping. The temperature is pretty good in my opinion, compared to other places I've been to where there's absolutely no AC. I like how there's also a wall with campus boards to train your skills further. At first I thought the price was a little high, but knowing that there's a gym and other amenities included with the price, it does seem worth it. The only thing I don't like is that you because you tie your own figure 8 knots here, you have to be checked on your belaying knowledge prior to climbing. If don't have experience with belaying, you'd have to spend a few bucks on a class and then get tested. It took half an hour to an hour before I was able to start climbing my first time there, even when I had prior experience climbing at other places. This only applies to top roping; bouldering does not require this inspection. Other than that experience with the inspection, Sender One is a fantastic place to climb.", "date": "5/1/2017"}

This is a post by a newbie to Sender One and rock climbing. Went with a group and only one person was able to belay (the person on the ground to secure the climber), so some of us ended up taking the belay class. It's $5 (after you rent the gears for another $5.) So, $10 in total. First timers to rock climbing, make sure you go with someone who is patient with you. Definitely you need a lot of encouragement to finish one course. You can climb in jeans but I did get some snags on my jeans after all the rough climbing. Also, \u00a0you'll be using chalk on your hands for better grip so dark colored clothing will show the chalk dust very well. I didn't give the entire 5 stars although my experience was quite memorable, because it can be quite pricey. There is a 10 use punch card for $165. The plus side is you can use the punch card for others as well. The downside is even if it is $16.50 per visit with the rentals it comes out to $21.50. For someone who comes on a regular basis of more than once per week, this place is worth it and the deal price. However, for someone like me who will walk in here few times a year is eh not much of a deal.

The community at the gym is a little strange- everyone is on their own, new people come every day. Everyone just kinda does their own thing, but the employees are awesome. The grading is pretty decent. I spent my time over at top-roping. At my regular climbing gym, I climb consistent V2s and working on V3s. I climb at ARC and they grade hard.

While we were waiting for our session to begin, more than one family popped in to find that the day was sold out. We filled out the waivers online too, which made it all easy.My kids are ages 6 and 10, and it was a good fit for both of them.Our session started right on time and lasted for the full 60 minutes. The climbing gym has at least seven different walls with colorful, different climbs. Signs posted next to each wall give hints for making the climb harder if you want to challenge yourself. All of the walls have an auto belay system to keep the climbers safe. Parents have an opportunity at the start of the session to get qualified to clip kids in and out. I did it because I didn't want my children having to wait around a lot, but frankly, I had to push the staff out of the way to be able to be of service. There were more than enough employees there to take care of all of the kids. I don't think anyone waited even 30 seconds. The staff were friendly enough to make it clear they wanted people to have a good time, while keeping the \"We are serious about enforcing the rules here-no funny business!\" attitude you'd expect in a place where not following the rules could have big consequences. This shows both my age and level of skepticism, but I was really surprised that the staff was so on point, given that they all seemed to be in their late teens or early twenties.

I've been to other gyms where different routes overlap all over each other, are in colors that are so similar that it gets confusing which one you're on, or aren't color-coded but rather use small stickers/tags to identify the holds on each route. I could see some people arguing that real outdoor climbing is not organized so nicely and so this setup is more realistic but for the gym environment I prefer the organization much more.Sender One also has a great balance of bouldering, top-roping, and lead climbing. There's also a good mix of easier problems/routes for those just starting out and much more difficult ones to appease the advanced climber. \u00a0I feel that a V0 or 5.9 is just right for a beginner at Sender, whereas other gyms I've been too have routes of the same grade that just feel way harder, like it should be rated 5.10a or something. Because of this, most of the climbers there are much more experienced and very strong, which definitely can make a beginner feel self-conscious or awkward. I know it's all relative but, simply put, I wouldn't take someone here that was interested in seeing what climbing was all about and wasn't already very physically fit. At Sender, I've already introduced a handful of people to climbing. By the same token, there are plenty of strong, experienced climbers at Sender One as well; it's just a better mix in my opinion.Lastly, the place itself is just nice, bright, and visually appealing. Not the most important factor I suppose but it's much better than some of the darker, danker, more enclosed gyms I've been too.All-in-all, after visiting a couple of other gyms, I still choose pay double (yes, double) the price of some other gyms and to drive an hour (Torrance to Santa Ana) to get to Sender One. When the LAX one opens in the summer, I'll be all over it.", "date": "5/4/2015"}

In one hour, they give you a tour, teach you the basics of top-roping, and give you some pointers on how to climb the walls with a belayer. All equipment comes with the rentals. After you're done for the day, they give you a one time offer: 5 days for $60 (normally would be $110). We took it and have been back every weekend since. The walls are very exciting and challenging. The staff are very friendly; we started off with Scott and he recognizes us every time we come back and catches up with how we are doing. The \"Sender City\" part has children and families running around (a lot on the weekends) but it doesn't really bother much; just goes to show how much fun this can be for families. I feel like I could climb here for years and not hit everything (still hadn't even gotten a chance to fully hit up their bouldering lanes). They have events all the time that are very popular among the clientele. Lastly, their product selection is everything you need for indoor climbing if you're looking to buy and get in it fully.

However, Randy, our instructor was very funny and helpful in teaching us the basics of belay. \u00a0He went through the course really quickly so if you're not a fast learner, you can hiccup at a few spots, but he would wait with you until you got it right. I still remember how he taught us to tie the knot - \"make an alien, choke the alien, poke him in the eye, and follow the train tracks\". The facility itself is so great that we changed our minds. The second time we came here, it was right before our membership was going to end. Since they were renovating the roped area with new cushions, we went bouldering instead.

They were demeaning, talking down to them, making fun of them, basically everyone's camp nightmare. The whole point of a camp is that ALL participants have a good time. The first time they were out of line, the ADULTS in charge should have pulled them aside and let them know they couldn't continue and the second time, actually notified the parents. Of course, none of this happened. They ignored what was happening (pretty hard to do when it's right in front of you) and let it continue. For hours. I found out about all of this at pick up where another child was so upset he crumpled up the certificate they gave him and threw it away in front of his dad. To make matters worse, someone had ordered a pizza (or thought they did) and didn't check on it or call it in. With a big camp, probably should have been called in. So on top of the negative camp experience, it ended on this note: leaving after realizing said pizza was MIA. After our own lunch elsewhere, my child confided in me that it wasn't fun. At all.

I lost my climbing brush that my friend gave to me a couple months ago and asked him to check the lost and found since he was the only one at the front desk. All he said was that it's probably gone now if it was three months ago... You could have at least checked for me. But oh well.

I went on a Friday afternoon so it wasn't packed, but there is so much space as it is. I also like that there's top roping AND lead climbing for the same courses. \u00a0In my gym, there are some courses that are only lead climbing, but maybe they do that on purpose. Anyway... One thing I noticed is their scoring method seems a bit on the easy side. A 5.10a at Sender is like a 5.8 or easy 5.9 at Stronghold. But that just depends on different gyms. I definitely felt more accomplished climbing at Sender One. (: There walls are taller though... Which I love! Make sure you know how to belay and tie a knot.

Because of the nature of Funtopia, where you have to conquer a fear of heights or a fear of falling, it really creates a bonding experience with those around you. So if you were scared, like me, to bring your different groups of friends together for one party, trust me, Funtopia is the quickest and easiest way to go about it. For my friends, even though they didn't know each other that well, they were cheering and encouraging one another, giving each other tips on how to complete a climbing wall, and some even raced each other on the timed walls. The part that I like most about Funtopia, other than jumping on the velcro wall and jumping off the 3 story block, is that it's mostly auto belayed. You just attach yourself to the caribiner and off you go. No one needs to stand there and belay you, everyone can do their own thing.The one con about this place is how they handle latecomers. My friend came 40 minutes late, and because it's only an hour session, and we were the last session there, she only had 20 minutes to play. They still charged her full price. That's $17 including $5 off yelp check in. I don't think that's fair, especially because they told me that if a friend didn't make it, it'd be okay and we wouldn't have to pay for them. So...it's a little odd why they charged her full price. UPDATE: They refunded her afterwards.Other than that great place for a party! Note that they can only hold a maximum of 20 people, so plan accordingly! Also, wear appropriate shoes, those flats aren't impressing anyone here.", "date": "3/12/2014"}

The sport and top rope walls are TALL and offer many routes of varying degrees of difficulty and style. \u00a0Haven't climbed a route yet that I dislike. \u00a0Movement tends to be very harmonious and fluid.The bouldering is not as plentiful as other bouldering gyms in OC, which is done on purpose here as they concentrate more on the quality of the problem vs the quantity of problems. \u00a0With that, the majority of problems flow with the same fluidity and technicalities as the routes, coupled with the inherent power and gymnastic-type movements you get with bouldering. \u00a0I recommend spending most of your time in the big green cave (see pics)The walls are GRITTY. \u00a0So smearing here works well, kinda like smearing in Joshua Tree...your foot is gonna stick...The walls are colored in a way that is rather unusual for climbing gyms throughout the area; see pics of the \"Ice Cream Wall\". I very much like this coloration difference; it's much brighter, welcoming and gives the impression of cleanliness vs the usual grey/brown/tan coloration you get at most gyms (i.e. if I wanted to feel like I was climbing outside, I would just go climb outside...)For both routes and bouldering, I tend to gravitate toward stuff that Chad Gilbert set. His setting and climbing style are very movement-based; I have yet to find a route or problem set by Chad that I haven't enjoyed or felt challenged on. \u00a0I would recommend his stuff over everyone else. \u00a0Look for \"CG\" on the tags~W.r.t training, they have a complete weight room, yoga room, a hydraulic system wall (i.e. you change the angle of the wall to be more overhung or vertical...how awesome is that?!?!) \u00a0with a vast amount of varying holds, multiple hang boards, campus board, etc. etc. \u00a0Pretty much a full-scale training facility for climbing. \u00a0As someone who spends more time training at an indoor gym than actually climbing, no gym in the area outdoes S1 in this regard.Locker Rooms; the place has showers, CLEAN showers I might add! \u00a0Sometimes I'm just too tired and I want to take a shower right away so I can get home and sleep. \u00a0Thank goodness they have some here!Criticisms:- The topout boulder could be taller. \u00a0Think Hangarside; their boulder is ridiculously awesome. I would love to see something like that at S1 in the future- The weight room could use heavier dumbbells instead of stopping at 50lbs?- Towel service for the locker room would be nice, especially for showering- Installing a soap/shampoo dispenser in the shower stalls would be cool too, rather than the random bottle of body wash---Overall---Service: A+. \u00a0Wes and Wes have been very accommodating at times, for which I am very much appreciative. Facility: A. Would love to see a taller top-out boulder.Atmosphere: A+. \u00a0So many people from surrounding gyms come here, making it the central point for all of OC's climbing community to meet up and climb together~", "date": "1/10/2014"}

I found this place on yelp and I am so excited that we were able to check this place out. This place is separated into a few courses. You can either 1) do an entry intro rock climbing class ~$30 2) rock climb in Funtopia $18 3) take a yoga class or 4) take a special class that's held on certain days, which include wine night or endurance rock climbing. We decided to do the Funtopia class for 1 hr, which you have to register online, but you can do the waiver online or in person. When we arrived, I was weary that the class was only meant for children since we were the oldest people there (besides the parents). However, after we started climbing - I realized that some of the obstacles were intense and realized how out of shape I was. Funtopia had give or take 10 rock climbing walls (decorated in a fun and cute way) which were about 30-40 feet high, and a couple of obstacles (slide, punching bag jump, glow in the dark wall etc). \u00a0My boyfriend and I raced each other on the timed rock climbing wall, which was fun. I also did the punching bag jump, which cost $3 dollars extra. Since we were older, we took a 3 minute intro class on how to work the auto-belay system. If you pass, you don't need anyone at your side every time you go to a new wall. Overall, I had such a fun time with my friends and would definitely do it again. was I had a great work out and had a blast doing it!

After a brief intro class, I learned the basic ins and outs of rock climbing and an extremely proficient figure 8 and double fisherman knot. I suggest you take the class with a buddy so you two could take turns belaying each other and make the most use of your day pass.I took a midday break and came back at night to find the place PACKED to the hilt. \u00a0It was really poppin' with people crawling like cats all over the walls. What's really cool about Sender One is that they change up the paths (routes? I don't know the official term) every few weeks to keep it fresh and all the paths are graded on the Yosemite Decimal System so you have a good idea of what you're getting yourself into. I love the sense of community at Sender One and the message board they have near the front really emphasizes that. \u00a0There are signups to find climbing buddies and there's even a section for suggestions and responses from the staff to show they acted on the suggestions.", "date": "9/9/2013"}

For all our complete lack of understanding of climbing, they took care of us well and made sure we were set to have fun.Our party of 7 arrived at 1pm and was told that the only space for a belay course was at 4pm. We were suggested to start with bouldering - perhaps just for the day, or perhaps if we hung on we could join the 4pm class. I don't know anything about how rock climbing courses are graded, but there was definitely more than enough there for our beginner skills to try. In fact, it was almost too hard for some of the younger and less fit of our party. They could only climb up the 0 grade walls that slope up to the cardio equipment. The rest of us had a decent selection of 0 grade walls around the room.We didn't get much of a chance to try belay climbing since only semi experienced person passed her belay test and belayed all of us, but it looked to be an even larger selection! Each of us did go up one belay climbing course and took celebratory pictures.As many have said, the corner to corner (except the center cubbies) bouncy mats made me feel pretty safe about mistakes. The center was also beautifully designed. I believe the courses even were named according to themes?Would definitely come back with another large group for bonding time! In the meantime though I think I'll stick to climbing my university's rock wall to get familiarized.", "date": "1/21/2015"}

The place is great and love the warmup area for the bouldering area. Easy routes and traversing wall which is neat! Cool top off problems. Walls are sticky.I like the down climbing holds which is a relief when sometimes you don't feel like jumping down ten to fifteen feet. As for the top roping if you don't have a harness, you can rent one as well as a small chalk bag for six bucks. Tying in is the a bit tedious but once you are in the fun begins. I really like the slab wall because it definitely makes you use your feet more a use the wall. Definitely helps with technique. As someone who has bouldering experience, top roping will kick your butt if you try to rush too fast. Easy, moderate pace will ensure you won't burn out.

We (my youth daughter and I) have been members since they opened 3 years ago. \u00a0Our daughter (now 12) has been climbing about 4 years and likes to compete. She loved the workouts and being on the team. I enjoyed the community of fellow parent climbers and that the 2 head coaches had a lot of experience, expertise, and degrees in kinesiology with an emphasis in exercise science. \u00a0They knew how to develop a young climber in a safe and effective manner. \u00a0Since we would spend a minimum of 9 hours a week at the gym for my daughter's practice, we \u00a0knew everyone that worked there and they \u00a0knew us. It was really nice. About a year ago, things changed. There started to be a very large turnover in the staff. Always new faces. \u00a0Prices kept going up and now the two head coaches are no longer coaching there. \u00a0The culture has changed and Sender is in the throes of opening a second gym in LA. There is palpable tension within the staff (maybe the high turnover, everyone fearing for their jobs?). The people working there are still very friendly, as are the remaining coaches. But, as a parent with a child that has been trained by coaches with such a vast depth of knowledge and experience, this situation didn't work for us anymore. We left the team and are training elsewhere.The gym is nice with high walls. Yoga, cardio, and fitness area are all good. \u00a0The routesetters keep things fresh by setting often - also great! The prices are expensive when you compare to comparable gyms. But, they are the only high wall gym in Orange County-captive audience. \u00a0In San Diego you have Mesa Rim which has a really nice community feel and outstanding gyms (multiple) for less money. They also have a thriving youth program. In LA, you have choices and less expensive, as well.", "date": "5/30/2016"}

Their rope climbing gym is truly grand and spacious, and they make sure to change it up at a good rate, but not too often.Speaking of rates, they aren't the cheapest, but with their (admittedly small) in-house gym, yoga studio, and membership discounts/perks on TOP of unlimited access to the climbing gym, it becomes really worth it!Super friendly climbing community too.

We were told our children would be placed into groups and they would try to complete all the climbs. Once we got into our group we tried to keep up but I felt that our children were not getting their stuff marked off on their papers. They set up these poor children to fail, they hype them up so much to complete this paper and realistically speaking if your child has never climbed anything before how do you expect them to go all the way up a 30 foot slide and let go???? How? Or climb another 30 foot ladder and throw themselves to catch a bar and if they don't they won't get the paper signed! One of the coaches was nice enough to sign my child's paper for trying the slide but at the end all my children focused on was trying to get their papers all signed that they did not enjoy the party!

I should state at first glance I wanted my children to like it and take the $100 dollar pass deal because it's 2 for the price of one but after the experience no way! I would not recommend anyone to come here. It is overpriced and the hour doesn't last long enough because everyone is in a group working to try to finish everything.

Everything else about this gym is an insult to the climbing community. I can't stand the money grubbing policies and poor management of this gym. I was excited for this gym to open and was a member from the very beginning, but as the months as a member dragged on, I couldn't bear to give them another penny for the following reasons (and then some):1. The bouldering is not good. The angles of the walls are pretty sloppy, and they don't fill it in with enough problems. Everything is very spaced out, sacrificing quantity for aesthetics, which is a shame because it's very easy to get bored in one session. There are definitely better places to boulder in Orange County.2. The owners do not take criticism well. After the systems wall was first set, I approached one of the owners (Wes C.), and made some comments. I was very nice about it, and just mentioned that I would like to see some incut crimps on there. He was SO rude to me; he insinuated that my opinion didn't matter, and THEN...he told me that I should talk to the head setter because he INVENTED systems wall training....ummm...okay....I'm pretty sure systems wall training has been around before Moses even started climbing...but I guess everybody lies on their resume, right? 3. They are very stingy about the air conditioning.4. They charge you an arm and a leg for classes that are free to members at other gyms.5. They are always putting on these little events that inhibit climbing for the members. For example, they had this series of competitions that seemed cute when they advertised it, but then they blocked off big sections of the entire gym to reset each time they had the event. So for weeks, there were consecutive days that it was impossible to climb. They also had this headlamp night where they turned off all the lights and people climbed by headlamp. I guess it was fun for the kids, but it was impossible to get a serious session in, and it was dangerous. There were tons of people with no headlamp etiquette walking around blinding you everywhere. Tilt it downwards if you're walking, people. And who knows what you're landing on besides the stiffest pads in town.In addition to all these obvious flaws in this gym, they also have a weird clique-y vibe going on. One of their employees was going around one not so busy morning, while she was working, straight up trash talking one of the most respected climbers in Southern California, not realizing that his friends were right there. I didn't think that was very professional. I would recommend this place to someone who wants to throw a party for their child. The Funtopia area seems really fun, and they probably host a good event. I would also recommend this gym to any friends who get super psyched about sport climbing on plastic. This is not the gym for people who are looking for a place to train for bouldering outside. The setting is competition style, with flashy toe hooks and cool looking moves, but not necessarily the hard down-pulling that people like to do to get strong. This is also not the gym if you are looking for a welcoming, judgement free climbing community that will nourish your growth as a climber. If you're looking for something new and exciting to do on a rainy Saturday, go for a day pass and check it out. You'll probably have a good time. If you're looking for a climbing gym to be a member at, where you'll meet cool people and improve your climbing, look elsewhere.", "date": "4/6/2014"}

Whenever I've gone to other gyms, I've always felt that something was missing, but Sender One has it all!People in OC are used to smaller, older gyms and can be intimidated by the price of Sender. They all get memberships after trying out Sender. :)Things I like, in order of importance:-Amazing route setting! What's the point of climbing a route if it ain't fun? Moses Potter's team has done a fabulous job, and CONSISTENTLY so, on both rope and boulder problems. Also, there are cracks of various sizes. -Tall walls. Sure, I've seen taller, but this is the tallest we have in the area! It's been a long time since I've been able to get a good pump on my arms in OC. -Awesome staff! They are so attentive and responsive! And employees here actually have climbing experience (outside, using real gear and real decision making) so you can discuss technique, climbing destinations, and most of all safety awareness. On top of it all, they are super courteous and sociable. I'm so sick of other gyms whose staff know nothing about climbing and/or treat customers poorly. Many gyms out there also encourage poor gear handling, which leads to serious safety issues, but I have full confidence in Sender's staff!-Awesome members! Everyone here is friendly and displays good etiquette. No obnoxious cliques with bad behavior (*knock on wood*). I haven't seen anyone yet whose climbing or belaying technique make me nervous. There is always a healthy amount of climbers around. -Full amenities! Locker room, showers, workout equipment, yoga, training walls, fitness trainers, etc! Your one-stop shop for fitness and convenience! There are also places where you can just sit and hang out with friends. -It looks GOOD! It's got the most aesthetic walls and route lines I've ever seen; clean, seamless padding with no gaps at wall edges or fissures under the covering; tight, smooth edges on the wall panels that show superb craftsmanship (with metal edging to protect your rope from wear); amazing texture that helps climbing and stays bright and clean; no creaking/flexing wood; and overall attention to detail that shows Sender was not cutting any corners. I also love the layout, which feels open and airy and allows for easy social interaction. Routes are also indicated by colored holds instead of tape, so you don't have to wonder whether a tape has fallen off your route. -It's CLEAN and free of workout/shoe funk! No ugly chalk spills on the carpet. Bathrooms are beautiful and clean. -Air conditioning!-This gym has novel features not seen before around here, including a regulation speed climbing wall and adjustable angles. Things I wish it had (minor things):-Autobelay for days when I don't have a partner and/or want to do reps on a route. I understand the reasons why gyms don't like providing one though so it's ok. I've also never had a problem finding a belayer either. -More sustained roof climbing on lead. \u00a0(There is roof bouldering though.)-More spacing between roped routes, since routes tend to overlap each other. I love this place!", "date": "7/20/2013"}

I am not a hardcore climber but do enjoy the occasional climb with friends and the workout from a good day of climbing. Prior to Sender One, I have only been to some of the SoCal gym which are rather small with walls only 25ft high and most of them reek of that sweaty foot smell. Well, not with this place, plenty of challenging routes with wall close to twice as high as the other gym. Bouldering area is freaking huge and pretty challenging too. Then again it could be my limited skill with bouldering and climbing in general but I do like that they have plenty of difficult routes if I ever get better at climbing. Basically it breaks down to below, so if you're serious, casual climber or just curious about rocking climbing, you owe it to yourself to give this place a try. Only bad part is that once you go here, you might not look at other gym the same way..and it was super busy on the grand opening day but then again it was a free climbing day so I am sure that's not the norm..- Place is super clean, nice locker room and most important of all none of that sweaty foot stink...-Huge top rope, lead climbing and bouldering area, something for everyone. They even have plenty of 5.7 to 5.8 routes for someone seriously lacking in the skills like myself..-Nice workout area with brand new treadmill, bikes and workout equipments..it's like a gym inside a gym..very nice. Yoga classes as well, although I am not much of a Yoga person, they do need to have heavier free weights though.-All the routes are color coded by the holds rather than a small piece of tape, so if I am climbing a 5.8 I know to only look for that one color grip hold, rather than look for a small color piece of tape which can be frustrating.-Working A/C and good ventilation...yeah that will matter when it's like 100+ outside...you're not going to find a big giant fan by the door only while everyone inside are sweating their balls off...for those with balls anywhere :)", "date": "7/5/2013"}

My bf and I joined S1 at the same time and climb 3+ times a week 2gether, yet he's the only one who gets greeted by first name every time we come in. I barely get a hello. The yoga classes are always filled w employees go don't make it a very inviting atmosphere. They gave me a huge hassle refunding my money for something they did wrong, first saying they couldn't, but I was persistent so they eventually refunded me. Unfortunate that the best climbing gym I've been to has employees that make me Not want to come back. This place could be a 10 with a whole new staff. $65 a month is too much to pay for a place that's run by a clique of employees. \u00a0So if you don't mind the employees flirting with your boyfriend or treating you like you're not pod enough, then this is surely the place for you.
