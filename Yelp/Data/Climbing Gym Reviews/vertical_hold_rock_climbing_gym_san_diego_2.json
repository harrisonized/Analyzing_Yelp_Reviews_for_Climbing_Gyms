We initially went to the Poway location, but now regularly go to the Old Town location. We started a couple's membership as we've been hooked on going back every weekend we can. SD/Old Town location definitely isn't as open as the Poway location, but has just as many great routes and staff. The Poway location has a bigger gym area, with 2 treadmills and a ping pong table. Vertical Hold staff members are always super friendly, whether they greet us or are helping out newcomers, they are always patient and willing to help. It seems like this location switches out routes on different walls every month or so, which helps keep routines from getting dry. There's always a challenging route that I want to complete before they switch it out, but also a great balance in easier routes for warm-ups and just being able to finish a climb. They have two auto-belays in case you come alone one day, and have several bouldering routes.Other climbers here are always nice, which is great to know there's a community here that is collaborative in giving pointers or tips for routes that may seem challenging to one person but isn't for another. I definitely recommend anyone to try rock climbing with their friends as it's a fun activity and gets your heart pumping - whether if it's from using all your muscle strength or the thrill of going to new heights you've never thought before!", "date": "5/10/2019"}

One of my friends has become a rock climbing fan and we decided to see what it was all about. The entire process was simple and easy. If it's your first time then you use one of the iPads next to the desk and fill out a waiver. One of the staff members hands you a harness then some shoes. The staging area has cubbies for you to put in your belongings. Once you're ready, one of the staff members will teach you how to clip on, climb and belay. They'll stay to ensure everyone understands what they're doing and leave when everyone understands the basics.They have multiple routes with various difficulties. You can start off with 5.7 or just jump into 5.10. There are two rooms and there is a small upstairs area in each room. In the main room, there is a slack line you can try to walk on. They also have some yoga mats since I guess they also have yoga classes in the same building. In the other room is a huge area for buildering and upstairs are some weight lifting equipment. Their bathrooms are clean and they have a tiny locker room area. Not sure if intentional but the guy's bathroom had moisturizer which is super helpful when you dry your skin with chalk. They have tape and band-aids at the front if you need them. The environment seems super friendly. The staff is always ready to help you out. People are very respectful and mindful of others. Some people will actually cheer you on. I think this is super important if you're just starting out in anything. Finding a sport you like and a supportive community is always essential to anyone's fitness journey. I would definitely recommend Vertical Hold to anyone looking for a rock climbing gym or just to try rock climbing.Also...if you're unsure about trying rock climbing they do have packages available to help you ease into it. They also seem to have technique lessons if you want to further your skills. Lastly, if you are still on the fence about it, think back to when you were a child and you climbed, jumped and explored everything. Rock climbing is the grown up version of that.", "date": "7/15/2018"}

Even so, as we went through the belay lesson (I don't remember now who took us through it, might've been Dorian), I never felt singled out or self-conscious about being a beginner, messing up the knots, etc. Staff were (and still are!) always very patient and accepting of all skill levels, and by the time we started going up the wall, we were at least confident that our knots would hold and we weren't going to die.After that, we started coming about once every 2-3 weeks for the next few months. Eventually we ended up getting our own gear instead of renting, but even when we were regularly using the gym's gear it never looked on the verge of dangerous--a little beat up, but sturdy. Staff are professional yet chill--it's clear they enjoy their work, are passionate about climbing, and aren't overly focused on making a buck. In fact, there were a few times when we were renting gear that the folks behind the desk would shrug and just tell us we could have it for free. (Don't take advantage of that, though--they deserve our money!) They also set new routes at a good pace, maybe every 1-2 months, which keeps everything new and refreshing.A year later, I'm climbing 5.10a's (and the occasional 5.10b on really good days), and my friend and I have the couple's membership. It's one of the best investments I make, IMO. We're not pros by any means, and I'm still pretty intimidated by the bouldering room, but whenever Wednesday rolls along and it's time to head to Vertical Hold after work, I'm always super pumped and excited.Only suggestion: a locker room would be great! Or at least a closing door with a lock to the women's bathroom area so there's a place for me to change from work clothes to gym clothes without taking up the only ladies' room in the place.", "date": "11/29/2018"}

I hadn't learned how to belay before, but the staff was OK with my sister teaching me without imposing any additional fees or mandatory lessons (as I've heard other places do). It's also great that dogs are allowed inside, which makes the experience livelier and memorable. Size: adequate size, since we came off-hours around 730pm on a Friday night.

I've been here plenty of times before the new ownership in late 2016, and it seems like the set up is practically the same. Plenty of walls for harness climbs, bouldering, routes that change regularly. The 18+ boulder room is still there: bigger walls to practice harness-free climbs with mats all around. There is also a mini gym upstairs in the boulder room if you wanna warm up! Complete with weights, olympic rings, kettle bells, racks for squats/bench, bicep curls etc. There are even some pull-up looking platforms with different holds to practice strengthening your finger/forearm grip. Fans all around for a good cool down after climbs. I should also mention the gym upstairs seems cleaner and upgraded from prior ownership.The staff is super friendly, easy to help set you up with gear, climbing 101, yoga classes-- whatever you need to get you and your group started. A lot of people seem to be regulars with memberships, also making it a fun place to watch people with more experience. Not gonna lie, their membership deals aren't too bad either. I'm considering becoming more of a regular and this place has that nice local gym feel I'm looking for.

I've been to others here in San Diego but this one takes the cake by far!! First off, yes they use gri gri belay devices; how awesome is that for newbies?! \u00a0I feel confident taking inexperienced climbers there, and teaching them the ropes. With so many routes to choose from, you'll never be bored. The ratings are a little off sometimes, but I'm also a shortie, so that probably has more to do with it than anything. Let's talk Boulder room: WOW! Incredible. Always on point with the routes, making it fun, and the traverse is rad too. I love how I can count on the routes to be changed frequently and you can follow solid rock on IG to see when routes are changing. You can utilize the natural features of the walls on some routes which is awesome. Customer service?? Yes!! \u00a0I have never once been treated poorly and the vibe in this place is super chill.

Friendly staff who are willing to.. literally.. show you the ropes ;)Cons: for the top ropers, although an OK place to learn if you've never done it before, the routes are kind of few and far between. The jump from white (easy) to 10.8s (the next lowest rating I could find) was a bit steep in my personal opinion. Also, the ropes and grigris seem \u00a0worn and old. When you descend, it's a cumbersome process for both climber and belayer because the ropes don't slide nicely through. You'll likely have to manually feed the rope into the grigri to speed it up (I'm about 110 lbs and my weight wasn't enough to lower me, so the manually feeding was a must haha). I prefer Mesa Rim myself, but I wanted to at least recognize this place for being kid-friendly and a good start for beginners.", "date": "4/23/2016"}

They are completely inflexible and do not understand the needs of their paying customers. They need a doctor's note even for a minor injury (a single visit to the doctor can easily cost $100!) in order to pause membership and in order to cancel membership it absolutely must be done by the 25th of each month, otherwise they charge you FULL for the next month. I tried cancelling it the following day and there was just no reasoning with them. We had every intention of coming back to this gym (we had to pause/cancel our membership for a few months) but now we're probably going to go to Vertical Hold instead. It's incredible to see how I couldn't possibly imagine changing gyms when I first wrote my review.

This place is by far the worst.Safety last. This gym does not require that you pass a belay test or take any type of instructional class in order to climb. \u00a0They have pre tied first gen Gri-Gris on bowlines with zip ties keeping the knots in place. \u00a0The locking biners and other hardware are ancient and many sides or corners of the biners were very sharp to the point that I was afraid they would cut either my harness strong points or the rope. The ropes have obviously never been replaced since their inauguration and were so worn and flat that they would often times not feed through the belay device. The routes clearly do not get reset and so the holds never get cleaned or replaced causing them to be very slippery. \u00a0A hold spun on me while climbing and when we notified the staff member she blankly stated, \"yeah, doesn't that make the route so much harder,\" as if that were a good thing. \u00a0She did not offer to fix the hold and we questioned whether or not the gym even owned an allen wrench. \u00a0If you belong to this gym please for the love of god get an experienced guide or mentor to teach you... basically everything over again before attempting to climb outdoors. \u00a0The guy at the front desk saw that I was belaying without ever taking my break hand off of the rope (I'm used to an ATC) and told me that since I was using a Gri-Gri I did not need to worry about keeping my break hand on the rope. \u00a0WOW!!! \u00a0Also, the two guys that were lead climbing were jumping around like apes and almost swung into me twice while lowering. NO, you do not need to or ever should clip the anchors and then jump out and sideways as far as you can to look cool after completing a route. \u00a0If you do this outside the rock can and will cut your rope.In point, the gym was gross and clearly not maintained, the staff was obnoxious and not knowledgable, and safety is clearly not a concern. \u00a0Also, the routes are some of the least creative and un-intuitive (basically they make absolutely no sense) routes that I've ever climbed on.Don't climb here.", "date": "7/3/2014"}

Seems like most folks are grossly uneducated on what Rock Climbing Gyms are like. Solid Rock offers more than 30 top roping routes, crack climbs, a phenomenal lead cave as well as exceptional bouldering. When novice climbers come in, or even those who have climbed before who just want a refresher, SRG gives FREE Belaying lessons. Why? Because safety IS priority there. The staff is incredibly knowledgeable and will answer any questions people have. Routes are reset every three months or so so that no one gets bored. Plus, you have time to nail those routes that shut you down a time or two. They also have an amazing kids climbing team. The coaches blow my mind with how encouraging and positive they are with these young kids. SRGs manager, Mike, is most definitely a no bull shit kind of guy, which is exactly what that place needs. In an environment where safety is essential, Mike does a fabulous job at keeping SRGs record of almost 20 years (which is the amount of time they have been established) of ZERO major accidents or injuries. They must be doing something right! I have three young kids and Mike has been incredibly patient with teaching them the rules of climbing and helping foster their skill. SRG has faithful and wonderful members and staff and I am incredibly grateful to have found them! Parking is not plentiful, but it is located in an industrial area... none of the businesses there have an abundance of parking, but there IS ample street parking. Don't cry about having to walk 1/8 of a block to get to the facility... you are going for a work out. Get over it. That is hardly a reason to give a negative review. Rock as a landing is actually what MANY rock climbing gyms use... when I jump down from a route I may have gotten shut down on when bouldering, I land in the rocks (only if I didn't have the crash pad near by... I usually set the crash pad further along my route for if I take a big fall). When doing so, the rock spread out to soften my landing. A mat would send a pretty impressive shock wave up my leg, and doing that repeatedly would surly result in an injury. Using the rocks allows for better distribution of the weight of impact, much like someone laying on a bed of nails. There is a scientific purpose, and clearly folks do not take the time to understand WHY things are done the way they are. Don't let someone's bitter review sway you from checking them out for yourself. Moral of the story: Solid Rock Gym Old Town will Rock your world. Pun intended.", "date": "12/5/2012"}

Most of these people are first time reviewers or perhaps think they know about rock climbing but clearly don't. To say Solid Rock never replaced ropes or routes is ignorant. I see them constantly working on setting routes and know they reset something at each of their locations every two months. The reason for any slippery or spinning holds is because of the amount of traffic coming through the doors. Anyone looking through reviews will notice how crowding is often mentioned. So what do you get when a gym is constantly busy and greasy hands are constantly climbing the holds, greasy holds all too soon. I climb here at least twice a week and get a crazy good work out and find the routes challenging and fun! The setters take time to perfect their work and tweak a route until it works. That said, they do grade a bit harder here than most softer gyms as they try to mimic the outdoors. There are easy routes but everything takes practice and I, at my start of rock climbing, felt discouraged. Come with an open mind and be positive please.", "date": "7/8/2014"}

We traveled near and far and got nothing short of OBLITERATED in every corner of the contiguous US of A. It was awesome, but spending most of the year either drunk or hungover took its toll on my body and probably my mind. It just took me 30 seconds to figure out if it's pronounced \"con-TIH-guous\" or \"con-ti-GYOO-us.\" My brain no worky so good and six. So we decided that 2013 should be the Year of ADVENTURE. After a soul-clearing trip to Yosemite we vowed to try something cool and new and exciting at least once a month, preferably something that would benefit our life-expectancy instead of slashing it nearly in half. This month, we wanted to try out a rock climbing gym because nothing says ADVENTURE like shuffling across plastic rocks indoors.I decided on SRG Middletown despite the multiple scathing reviews for two reasons: proximity and price. It's pretty close to us, and for our first time (and because we figured we'd only last like, twelve minutes before collapsing in a sweaty heap on the floor [that's what she said]), the $23 initial price (as opposed to Vertical Hold's $31 and Mesa Rim's $30) seemed the best use of our money. In retrospect, we probably should have dropped the extra dough for a legit lesson in belaying and knot-tying at one of the other gyms, because the SRG \"belay lesson\" was pretty bare bones. I can kind of understand people feeling like the safety was lacking (especially if they're \"heights averse\"), but if you pay attention and use common sense there really shouldn't be an issue. I do wish they'd given us a tour or explained the numbers and color rating system and whatnot, but I'm sure if we'd asked they'd have gladly helped.As for the \"GROSS\" shoes everyone speaks of, I personally did not notice any particular stench. Then again, I don't stick my nose in RENTAL ROCK CLIMBING SHOES TO CHECK FOR CLEANLINESS BECAUSE I AM NOT DISGUSTING. The climbing itself was a blast - we showed up early (about 9:45) so even for a Saturday we had no trouble getting to climb as many routes as we wanted - although a little girl's birthday party started on our way out... I can't IMAGINE how the place looked then. The Dude enjoyed bouldering more than the top rope climbing, so we spent some time in that room too. Within about an hour and a half, my hands were too tender to continue, although I wished I could have kept going all day! That shit it FUN, yo. I can definitely see myself getting into climbing once I develop some callouses on these frail little flower petal fingers. I'm sure we'll eventually hit up some of the other climbing gyms in the area, and maybe then we'll understand the hate goin' on. For now, though, Solid Rock is A-OK.", "date": "3/10/2013"}

I wouldn't say it's the best gym in town because it lacks some standard gym amenities, but they do have some great climbs. The staff are friendly and the regular climbers are cool too.I think it's good for first timers and from what I've seen they do a good job with kids parties. They usually have groups of kids coming through for summer camps and parties so the staff are all used to dealing with the kids. During summer and school holidays there are a lot of kids on the top-ropes but the boulder room and lead-cave are always kid free. What made me convert from the occasional day pass to an annual member is the 18+ boulder room. The overall shape, and even the texture, of the new boulder is fantastic. They are able to create some really great routes. I wish they had a padded floor rather than the rocks and crash pads though. Nothing more sketchy than trying a dynamic move with your heel hooked in a horizontal position 10 feet from a pile of rocks.I also agree with some previous posters that the ratings seem to be easier than they actually are. A 5.9 top-rope at Solid Rock is probably 5.10 at other gyms, I can see how that might bruise the ego of the visiting climbers but I like it. Whenever I go to another gym or outside I'm able to complete routes one rating higher than I can do at Solid Rock.They also have a free weight gym upstairs, but it rarely gets used during the day. For me, this is where they loose some points. I can see that it doesn't get used much during the day, and that's probably why the're not investing in it, but maybe it's not being used because it's so small and lacking some basic equipment like an elliptical or cycle. More than 3 people in the weight room and it's overcrowded. I'm sure 95% of the people that come in are only there for the climbing so it's understandable that they don't invest in it, but I'm in the other 5%. On the positive side, at least they *have* a weight room. They have several benches, full rack of dumbbells, plenty of barbell plates, rings, and finger boards. \u00a0I'd like to give 5 stars, but there are a few things that bug me:- Need to clean up the lockers, they are all covered in chalk dust. The bottom of the locker shelves are as dirty as the floor. - The weight room is also covered in chalk dust because that's where the finger boards and rings are. - Get at least one elliptical or cycle for some cardio. Just truck one down from the Poway gym!- Need to maintain the tape on the routes. Nothing makes a route more difficult than an unmarked hold. The top-rope routes are pretty well maintained but the boulder gets more and more difficult as the tape falls off.- It would be really nice if they went for a more traditional gym approach with the weight and locker rooms.Even with the few gripes I have, I'm happy with my membership here. I plan to have future birthday parties for my kids there when they get older and I will likely renew my membership as long as they continue to invest in new holds and keep that boulder room fresh.", "date": "4/8/2011"}

I guess the price is average (at least in SD) but I refuse to come here when I'm not apart of a long term membership because the per-visit cost would kill my wallet.My biggest complaint here is that the routes are poorly taken care of by staff. My favorite climbing style is bouldering and the boulder section is always missing tape from routes or is hanging on by it's last sticky bit of life and the employees don't fix it. The employee's tend to sit behind the counter even when there is more than one on the clock and I feel like they shouldn't. If even just once a day, they checked the tape and replaced ones that are needing to be replaced, this place would be at least a star better. It's almost like no one has any pride or ownership of this place. Even when I ask an employee where I'm missing tape, they might tell me what they think it was and they still wont care to fix it and if they made rounds just once a day, there would never be a lot of work to keep it maintained. it's frustrating! The ropes are old and they feel gross. I want them teach people how to belay and how to put a grigri on a rope properly or just anything that will teach someone something. I guess my only other complaint is that the gym is small but with a membership and enough gas money, you can visit their Poway gym which is betting in my opinion and not much further than Vertical Hold.", "date": "7/18/2010"}

Next.\" \u00a0I've seen tons of dangerous belaying here - teens 2/3 up the wall and the belayer hasn't taken any rope. \u00a0The staff should definitely pay more attention to this sort of thing. - crowds!!! \u00a0It's small, and it's horrendous when they have parties of screaming kids (all the time!!). There's nothing more annoying or unsafe than a bunch of unsupervised kids running wild and doing idiotic stuff like standing directly below climbers who are bouldering or being belayed down. \u00a0The parents are even worse because they do the same things and should know better. - one of my biggest peeves is that the staff doesn't care if customers \u00a0throw their water bottles, backpacks, etc. on the ground near bottom of the wall you're climbing. \u00a0You land on that crap and you'll break your ankle. \u00a0No one cares.

We told the girl that it was our first experience and she took us and two other girls who've never climbed either to a wall and briefly explained the basics: how to hold, how to lock etc...all in about 5 minutes (which at the time seemed enough for me until I went to vertical hold and was impressed at how much time they spent teaching you the proper ways of things). I climbed up the wall and felt such joy when I got to the top, that is until I looked down and imagined myself plummeting to my death. 'Okay now lean back and let go of the wall' the staff yelled up at me. 'Are you crazy woman!' I yelled back down at her. I was prepared to climb up, but wasn't prepared for what I had to do when I had reached the top. The trainer didn't check to make sure that the rope was taut, so when I finally let go of the wall I dropped a bit. Scary stuff when it's your first time. I don't always understand the routes. I imagine someone around 6ft is the one that's setting them, because the distance between the rocks are near impossible for someone of my height to reach. The rocks are not always screwed in properly, so sometimes when you step on a rock it'll shift causing you to loose your footing. I guess they're trying to give you that real life feel to climbing, getting you used to rocks slipping under you. The place is small but the staff are really friendly and so are the patrons.

I come from Threshhold Gym in Riverside, check it out if you're in the area.Back to Solid Rock- I was visiting my boyfriend's cousin out there and we had some time to kill, so we brought his cousin for her first time climbing. We'd never been there before but we assumed it would be cool to try out a new gym. She liked it for her first time, but we totally hated it.The gym passes are so damn expensive for what you get! Okay, if you are new to climbing then sure, knock yourself out- but I didn't get ANYTHING I paid for. It was $16 on the weekend for a freakin' adult pass. So what does that get me? Access to crappy EVERYTHING. Why?1) Their holds are never cleaned. Judging by the look/feel of it, every hold was greasy and left uncleaned from probably MONTHS.2) The workers ALLOW people to climb with normal shoes on. HELLO, that is what makes all of the holds so greasy! You should be climbing with shoes that have rubber soles specifically meant for climbing, or you will be greasing up the holds and people like me won't have fun slipping off anything and everything!3) Their route (and bouldering) ratings are COMPLETELY OFF. I did a 5.9 route that probably would have been a 5.10 outdoors with a 5.11 crux. I checked their website, and they even have a section that says \"Interested in route setting?\" so really, like ANYONE can come in and set up a route? No wonder why their ratings are so inconsistent! Also, I warmed up on this supposed-to-be V0 in the adult section (yes, the bouldering is in a separate room that is 18+ years old only... but I still saw children in there), and that in my eyes was a V3. What kind of V0 really makes your feet cut in the gnarliest way so that you can fly backwards and eat a mouth full of...4) ...PEBBLES. What the hell, really... typically all climbing gym floors should be padded! but PEBBLES!? They filled the entire gym with pebbles (or may I say little rocks, because these were NOT Cocoa-Pebbles-sized pebbles, they were pretty huge). In addition, They had a limited about of crashpads that were all disproportionate and ripped up because they were handmade and stuffed with cheap foam. Accidents happen, and sometimes people don't land ALL on the crashpad... in fact, my boyfriend landed one foot on the pad and one foot on the pebbles and his ankle started hurting, even with me spotting him!5) This gym does not teach safety or how to do things properly. Yes, for convenience on all the ropes they have attached a gri-gri and have tied it in so that you cannot take it off and put it back on improperly... but I still see people clipping themselves in in some kind of stupid fashion that makes it five times harder to bring someone down. 6) Their gear is all worn out. Just like the uncleaned holds, their gri-gris are extremely worn out, as well as their ropes. Try to replace some of this stuff every once in a while! With the money they are charging for day passes and memberships, it's unacceptable to have this low-grade stuff in this gym.The only thing I looked forward to was that they had a crack climb section, however the inside of the crack was completely smooth from too much chalk and usage, and the crack was way too big to do a single handjam, so I kept slipping.If I had to rate this gym, I'd give it a big fat F. This place is completely unacceptable for experienced climbers and probably even dangerous for people who are inexperienced! Judging from the crowd, this place was filled with a lot of little kids running around with tennis shoes on, so I assume maybe this gym caters to little kids and people who are inexperienced. Even still, the upkeep is unacceptable- this gym is expensive and unkempt. If i had the option to give it NO STARS and even take the ones they earned away! believe me, I would. If I was in the area and had to satiate my craving for climbing, I'd rather bring a hammer and chisel off a random boulder in the area rather than go to this gym.", "date": "3/3/2011"}

The staff is pretty hands-off which makes me feel comfortable, as they're not breathing down your neck and/or judging you, and if you specifically ask them for help they're pretty responsive.Their top-roping routes starts have an easy way up (the Girl Scout route), then increase in difficulty to 5.7 and above.

So I am a bit biased, but some of these complaints are just completely wrong. The staff are rude and uncaring? TOTALLY not true, they will come out there and help you with ANYTHING, belaying, fixing a broken/loose hold, or missing tape, they will even come out and help with bouldering problems sometimes. And so what if they play around behind the counter? It isn't as if they are leaving people without help. I would much prefer fun employees with personality over staunch and stuffy ones.Ok yes, at first the gravel does not seem like a good idea, but trying falling on it! I have fallen flat on my back many a time and it is not what you would think. Also, I know climbers there, including myself, who would rather fall on the gravel than a pad. It displaces the impact very nicely. At Mesa Rim, letting go feet first onto those flat mats scares the crap out of me, I feel like I could break my ankle. I would rather fall on rocks any day.Now when people say the routes are poorly set, yes, there is some validity to that. Many of them are harder than the routes in most gyms, despite the fact that they have low ratings. But, this makes it much more realistic to outdoor climbing! So when that guy from the bay area complains that on a 5.7 he only has a foothold to step up on for the next move, he is actually clmbing much more realistically than he would if he simply had to reach up to a nice jug! All over the gym, there are white routes that are SUPER easy, so quit your griping!I am not much of a top roper, I am mainly a boulderer, but when I read these complaints about the belay devices, it blows my mind! TOO EASY TO USE?!?! What the hell is wrong with having a belay device that a beginner could use right off the bat? It works for them, and it works for all those experienced top ropers. If you want the real experience, just go to the lead climb cave! There you get all of the fun of the real thing in a safe place.The one complaint I would ever have, is the kids. If you can, try try try your best to avoid the middle of the day on weekends or during the summer. But they have to make money somehow right? Just go in the evening/night! The other climbers are so friendly, I guarantee that if you go alone, you'll leave with at least 2 new climbing buddies. All-in-all, yea it's a bit dirty. Yea some of the routes are harder than they are rated. And yea there are kids that run rampant during the day. But for me, there is no other choice for a sure fire good climb. I know that when I go, I can spend hours and hours just trying a few problems until I get them down perfectly. Plus, the harder climbs, make me a better climber when I go other places. The charm of this place, trumps everything else I've ever been to.", "date": "8/5/2010"}

This review will hopefully give you a heads up so that your visit may be more enjoyable. \u00a0 \u00a0 The first thing you do when you enter this or any climbing gym is SIGN YOUR LIFE AWAY. This should ring a bell. \u00a0It's DANGEROUS PEOPLE,but If you expect someone to hold your hand and baby you, forget it and go ride a bike. \u00a0 \u00a0Beginners: \u00a0This gym uses fixed carabineers and grigris on the top ropes. \u00a0This means that less practice is required to belay safely and less time is spent tying in,so you get to climb more. \u00a0Pay attention when the staff explains how to use the system. \u00a0If you don't get it, ask again. They will help you. There are lots of climbs for beginners.  \u00a0 \u00a0intermediate climbers: The top rope climbs rate from 5-8 to 5-12. \u00a0The ratings can vary widely so expect to get spanked on some routes that are rated at \u00a0what you think your level is. \u00a0They change the routes faster than I can get used to them, and I think rating stuff is dumb anyway. \u00a0I do set routes there from time to time and my feeling is that, if you are always looking at ratings as an indicator, then it is much better for me to sand bag the numbers so that you don't go outside and get yourself killed on something you thought you should be able to climb. \u00a0If you get my 5-10b then you are pretty much in there for 5-10b's.  \u00a0 \u00a0Experts: \u00a05-13 and up. \u00a0Well, you are mostly out of luck. \u00a0You would probably like the lead cave and could get a long workout in but there simply aren't enough of you to justify setting routes in that range. \u00a0 Bouldering: \u00a0They have a great new top out boulder, and kids are not allowed. It really is way cool,but it scares me. \u00a0 The only complaint I've heard is that the problems are not hard enough, but I hear a lot of grunting and yelling when I pass by. \u00a0I really don't want to know what is going on in there. \u00a0Oh! They have a slack line and a peg board. \u00a0How about that? \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Lead climbing: \u00a0I think this is the best lead \"cave\" I've ever climbed in. \u00a0It is really overhung and intimidates most climbers, but it is a total kick. \u00a0The routes run from 5-9 to 5-13+ (only one) \u00a0with most in the 10+ to 11+ range. You have to get certified to climb lead. \u00a0You can tie in with a dbl. figure eight or a dbl. boline, with backup. \u00a0You have to understand back clipping and z clipping;that is know not to do it. \u00a0This gym provides rope and the atc. Once you have tested on a climb and passed, \u00a0they leave you alone, something I like. \u00a0To enjoy the cave you are going to have to be a very solid 5-10 climber. \u00a0You have to give the desk something of value to check out the ropes. \u00a0I keep a kid in the back of my truck for just such occasions, but keys or I.D. will work they tell me.  \u00a0 \u00a0If you are just beginning to lead, there is another flat section in the gym where you can check out a rope and \u00a0practice lead with a top rope belay. \u00a0 \u00a0If you hate kids, or crowds then check ahead. They do have parties up over the boulder. \u00a0Sometimes they will give you treats if you perform well in the lead cave, a plus. \u00a0 \u00a0They do not have showers. \u00a0Do you really want to step into a public shower? \u00a0You have no idea what just went on in that space you are stepping into. \u00a0They \u00a0have lockers in the new boulder area, really nice, carpet, even a table with magazines and stuff. \u00a0Alas they are not coed. \u00a0No juice bar either. \u00a0 \u00a0 I admit that gravel in the top rope areas is not really necessary, and mats would be cleaner, but that isn't the way the gym was made years ago. \u00a0However, I can personally tell you that if one of your bozo friends isn't paying attention and drops you twenty feet in the lead cave, you are going to kiss that gravel for breaking your fall, twice. \u00a0 \u00a0I like the staff, friendly,enthusiastic, but not hovering. \u00a0I like the routes, always a challenge whatever the rating. \u00a0I especially like the people I meet there, always nice, willing to give advice or a belay, and they let this old guy hang with them, sort of. \u00a0I take all the other little picky complaints, too dusty, hate gravel, lose holds,fat ropes,kids, no Beethoven's ninth on the c.d. with a grain of salt, because you won't find a nicer bunch of gym rats anywhere.", "date": "9/25/2010"}
