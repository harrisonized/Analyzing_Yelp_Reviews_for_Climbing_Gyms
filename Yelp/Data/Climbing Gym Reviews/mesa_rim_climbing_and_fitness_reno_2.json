They have the usual findings in gyms - cardio equipment, free weights, etc. And they have amazing yoga classes which they're always adding classes to. And of course, their climbing is amazing. Their climbing staff is always setting up new routes. The gym is spacious enough that it never feels like we're waiting very long for routes to open up. They also have a sauna! Great for post-workout or on a cold winter day when you just need to warm up. It is co-ed so come prepared with a swimsuit or just go in your yoga clothes. They have free wifi (weeee!!!) and chairs and tables upstairs so you can do your work. The balcony lets you spy on your friends or little ones.

I LOVE MESA RIM!I didn't really get into climbing until I used a buddy pass at Mesa, and it completely changed my attitude from \"once in a while\" to \"I want to be good now\". Mesa is a beautiful gym. It's massive and has a huge variety of both ropes and bouldering. Plus the routes change frequently so you're never bored!Mesa Rim also offers a weight lifting gym, yoga classes, cardio machines, and other less common events such as woman's bouldering, competitions and more! They have a suggestions box, and they share peoples comments and concerns and take a real effort to address these which is great. The staff is super friendly and actually gets to know you. This is something that I find dire in a gym. Many people get discouraged from going and working out at a gym, but being greeted and remembered makes it a lot easier to keep up on your fitness. There are also showers and a sauna which are nice to use after a good workout. \u00a0Only downside for me is the shorter hours on the weekends, but it makes sense considering people probably do not come late on those days.", "date": "4/10/2019"}

I just did bouldering and did not attempt the ropes courses although those are extensive. The bouldering is labeled with difficulty level like other places, but the entry level routes here seem a tad harder than some I have tried at another place in town. It was a satisfying challenge to complete!Thursday was also leg day for me and our workout buddy, and the resistance area of the gym here had enough equipment for us to do our whole workout in. I've attach some pictures of the workout area with this review since I don't see any on here.

Their boulder wall is a little taller than I'm used to but I really appreciated how many different types of courses there were, all clearly labeled with the difficulty. The gym was PACKED when we came on a Thursday night but it was surprisingly easy to find a wall to climb although we had to park on the street. This being a fairly newer gym, everything was beautiful and in top shape. Definitely a higher end climbing gym!

I was skeptical of the place at first. One part nostalgia for good 'ol Rocksport, and one part for, \"Did we really need a third gym?\"The more and more I climb here though, the more it seems like the ONLY gym in Reno. The route setting is really good. Like really really good. \u00a0I'm sure the insane selection of new, high-end holds and the badass volumes on brand new walls is helping the cause, but they are creative setters without a doubt as well. I noticed they have a construction boom lift in their arsenal for setting their walls. This tool is paying dividends in route quality. The setters are clearly getting to focus on putting up awesome routes, instead of the logistics of getting holds on tall, overhanging walls.Many of the routes do not give my very short girlfriend trouble either. \u00a0For example there is a blue .11+ in their tallest dihederal right now that might be one of the most outdoor feeling, creative, flowing routes I've ever climbed in a gym. \u00a0Both me (6'1\") and her (5'1\") loved it. That only happens with thoughtful, creative setting. At any given time there are usually about 10-12 standout routes like this that push the creative envelope. The routes have never gotten stale to me, going about 2 times a week. Seems like their cycle is around 2 months per route, which is pretty fast when you consider the sheer volume of climbing available here at any given time.The facility is massive, well lit and laid out. Music selection is generally to my liking, staff is super friendly. This is a climbing facility that is triple the gym for nearly the same cost as the competition. \u00a0I think this form of fitness will only continue to grow as non-climbers discover high quality places like this.", "date": "1/4/2019"}

It improves in so many ways on Rocksport and on Basecamp, Reno's two existing climbing gyms. Don't get me wrong: I've enjoyed climbing at both of those other gyms, and I'm just finishing my second year of being a member at Rocksport ($420 a year or $45 a month). But when my fianc\u00e9 and I learnt in April 2017 that yearly memberships to Mesa Rim were available ($630 a year, initiation fee waived), it took us about 15 minutes to look at the websites for the Mesa Rim San Diego gyms and to realize that whatever was going to be built over the summer was going to be worth signing up for. Why is Mesa Rim so fabulous? First, it's new and clean! Second, it is HUGE. There are so many tall walls for top roping and lead climbing, and so many walls for bouldering. And there's even a top out bouldering wall, which means that one hasn't finishing climbing the route until one gets one's legs and body over the top. Even though I've been climbing for over two years, I started as a super duper beginner, so I'm still learning how to do things like top out. My fianc\u00e9 and I primarily boulder, and there are so many VB to V2 routes for me and more advanced routes for him. Members get a varying number of guest passes (unlimited in July before their grand opening in August!), and I've bought three of my girlfriends on my guest passes to try climbing. Shoe rental is $5. If one wants to climb the tall walls, taking a belay lesson is required. Reserving a lesson online or in person is required. If a climber has the knowledge to pass their belay test, he or she can test at any time, which is what my fianc\u00e9 did. I, on the other hand, am not confident in my knowledge (and Rocksport made it super easy with its auto-belays and already-attached gri-gris), so I still need to take their lesson to use an ATC belay device. Mesa Rim double loops the ropes at the top whereas Rocksport only single loops the ropes, and I'm excited to come down the wall much more smoothly as a result. That is, if I make it to the top of the tall walls: they are hella tall!Other reasons for awesomeness: there's a yoga studio, four cardio machines, two rowing machines, comfortable fancy chairs for relaxing and chatting upstairs, a ton of free weight equipment and a big area in which to use them, and a steam room (clothes required!). Oh, and clean bathrooms!!! (Rocksport, maybe this will inspire you to clean your nasty bathrooms!) The people who work here are friendly, and the vibe is excellent. Best of all, the staff is actively taking suggestions for improvement via anonymous cards in a drop off bin! In the two weeks that I've been climbing, they've already made many of the improvements and posted the suggestion cards with their responses. SO COOL! I'm so glad that Mesa Rim is part of our community: it's a fantastic place to climb.", "date": "8/7/2017"}
