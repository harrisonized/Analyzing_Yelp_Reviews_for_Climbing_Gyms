I find the layout and interior of this rock climbing gym to be more appealing than other rock climbing gyms, but I can't entirely wrap my head around why. Right when you walk in on the left, there is a bouldering section right there as well as another larger bouldering section in the back, and ample variety in rope climbs. They also have three automatic belays which is great if you happen to be waiting for your friends to arrive (it's also nice to switch it up every once in a while). This place can become rather packed, especially after 5 PM, but there is so much climbing space that it doesn't really phase me. If you plan on going often, I suggest getting the punchcard because you'll be getting a better deal. Best rock climbing gym I have been to so far.", "date": "4/6/2019"}

He is patient and has a way of making you feel like you're doing great even when you aren't. I decided to go back because of how awesome Steven was. Here's where it gets tricky- I went back about 2 weeks later with my coworker in the morning to climb because we learned that we get into Vertex for free since we just got the job at our school's climbing wall. We walked in and the lady at the front desk acted like we were crazy for saying that. She then asked a lady named \"V\" and she confirmed. We asked for harnesses and shoes and V acted like we were incompetent for asking that. We then waited about 20 minutes for our belay test because V was changing the music instead of helping customers. Once she asked us to start belaying she rudely said \"Is that how you learned to belay?\" to my friend who hadn't even started yet. V then did an \"accidental fall\" where she yanked the rope as hard as she could and pulled me across the floor and jammed my knuckles into the counter. I now have a bruise. V is completely disrespectful and doesn't seem to care about anybody but herself. She acted like people who didn't have their own equipment were dumb and didn't seem like she wanted to help us.", "date": "4/9/2019"}

I recently went to Vertex with my two young daughters and girlfriend for a little climbing. I have been to Vertex with my kids about a dozen times or so over the last year, my girlfriend is an avid climber. Upon getting to Vertex the nice guy behind the counter asked me several times about my belay card, bordering on the absurd (I did show him my Vertex belay card). While getting ready the young man came over and asked to see my card, he wanted to see who actually issued me the card, keep in mind that I was getting ready, it wasn't like he saw me do anything wrong and he was double checking the validity of my belay card. I don't look like the typical climber, I'm 6' 240lbs and of the darker complexion (my people aren't the typical climbing type). At this time I felt I was being harassed, or at the very least accused of doing something. I let it go, but I watched other people entering in and not once did he ask to see a belay card from the white members (I know, I said it), and one of the guys I knew and he wasn't an avid climber at all. I spent good money to take the class to get my belay card, punch cards for my daughter, and drop-in fees. I'm a little offended at my treatment, and I don't know if it was related to my color. I have had this feeling before when going into stores back in my college days and I was the only one asked to leave my backpack at the counter, so you get my drift. I find that the staff there are hit and miss, arrogant and self-absorbed at times. In all fairness, I did try and contact the owner Gorden Cooley to talk to him before posting this, but my msg. fell on deaf ears, but in all fairness, I had to give the young lady who took my msg. my number about ten times before she got it. In my over twenty years of being in the outdoor industry I have learned a few things that I believe are true about this situation. One, this falls under poor ownership & poor management category. Two, the staff at Vertex has no direction, or work ethic. And finally, management either doesn't see it, or fails to do anything about it because they behave in the same manner. The new owner has steadily raised his dues since he took over and most of the members haven't seen any real improvements on the \"Vertex Experience\", maybe he should use the money to get better staff. Ultimately the new climbing gym coming to town will be a breath of fresh air, and I'm sure lots of Vertex members will be making the move to the new climbing gym.", "date": "11/14/2018"}

I walked up to a girl at the front desk to let her know I was ready to fill the paper work out before class started. She rudely told me someone will help me.

The same girl thought I needed something from her and looked up rudely and said what's up guys what can I help you with. She seemed pissed to be at work. And incredibly annoyed with me. Then after we met our nice instructor I realized there was no way I could climb and watch my boys as well. I gave my harness back and was promptly refunded my 25$ portion.

Everyone was friendly and our belayer was not only super sweet and encouraging but gave excellent instruction!! They also honored a gift certificate that was probably over 10 years old! I hope to get back to this place soon. :)", "date": "9/24/2016"}

People are down to earth and friendly and excited about climbing! There are soo many routes to choose from (though sometimes, it's actually hard to follow the routes because there is so much tape on the walls). The routes are nice and challenging, I think. The place is big enough with lots of top roping (I don't do much bouldering).As for facilities, those are great too. There are showers with soap and shampoo. Places to store your stuff. And outside there's a balance beam thing, and a tire swing and just a nice general outdoor chill area to get a break from the gym when you want to walk around for a little bit. There's also a great community bulletin/posting board by the drinking fountain. And the staff. Always friendly. Always helpful.If you're thinking about going -- go. :)", "date": "7/29/2014"}

In the end this is a really cool place, and we did encounter some nice, engaging staff out on the floor, but this front desk experience was such a turn off, I would not recommend it to others.", "date": "10/28/2015"}
