I'm so glad to have started my bouldering and top rope experience at ACG.

The staff/owners - Trevor, Brent and Dillon are all really friendly and open to giving pointers and safety tips. I have only had positive and friendly encounters with them (and also with their cute doggie)! Some of the climbers here say that the routes at ACG are more difficult than some other gyms in the area (i.e. a v1 at ACG is a v2 elsewhere). Part of that might be due to the fact that some of their bouldering walls are taller, enabling the route setters to create longer (and more interesting as a result) routes. Another cool aspect of the gym is that the people who boulder here are so chill.

He's a rad guy who always seems cheerful and always happy to stop whatever gym-improvement related task he's on to help out a member with anything. He even remembered me by name since day 1.If I had to give some sort of comparison/analogy for this place, I'd call it a \"mom n' pop\" climbing gym. Granted, I haven't been to many of the other gyms in OC (just a couple), but this one felt different right away in comparison to the other gyms.I've seen all types of skill levels in here and I've yet to see the place get crowded to the point where it interferes with my climbing (let alone being crowded at all). If a certain wall is taken, there is always another wall with the same level route that's open and even if you're sharing a wall with someone, the crowd is friendly and everyone takes turns.A shower, bigger bathroom, etc. would be cool as someone else mentioned, but I've looked into leasing warehouse space myself and know that those are hard to come by - no big deal, there's a 24 hour fitness across the street for showering before work.Ideas for improvement: Although I doubt anything would ever get stolen from this place, having the little cubbies for your stuff in view while climbing would be cool just to keep an eye on your phone, keys etc. Maybe move the cubbies onto the angled wall next to the wave?Anyway, I need to stop wasting time on Yelp and go climb. Awesome gym. definitely renewing my membership after the Groupon expires.", "date": "7/19/2015"}

Literally. My years at Solid Rock Gym saw little growth or expansion, but when the Lake Forest location closed Orange County was left with a void. Since then gyms have popped up all over Southern California and dare I say it climbing is going mainstream. It's modern, it's adaptive and the training ground for the TOP climbers. Well these guys sure had a dream to fill that void with really what climbing has needed in OC and beyond. I heard rumors of a San Clemente gym and now there is TruHold in Mission Viejo, Sharma's new gym coming, obviously Hangar 18, Mesa in SD, Vital bouldering walls in Carlsbad, but let's be honest if you don't go to Rockreation or Rock City the 2 most established gym's besides SRG when they left you were stuck driving way out of your way. Aesthetic and Truhold serve a much bigger population which is great for us as a community. The Arndt brothers (Dillon & Trevor) and Jeremy Meza have done a great job addressing a lot of the downfalls of previous gyms in the area and abroad. Not to sound like an elitist, but too often kids are exposed to climbing in more of a babysitting way, relying on excellent gym employees to wrangle them, keep their interest and whatnot. Having a staging area for comps, having event specific area's for kids to have their parties and a separate vertical top rope area keeps everybody safe and happy. The Yosemite and Joshua Tree room are decorated so well it's almost a shame kids will likely thrash it eventually. Members and nonmember alike fully enjoy the top out boulder, training room, and top ropes. Lead area requires the passing of testing certification. The training room lets people get on intervals where you can crank out and hours' worth of toproping or bouldering in half the time. Like I said earlier gyms are the training ground and with these new state of the art padding systems you don't have to worry about dirty rocks ever again. Makes us setters happy because it's less we have to clean. I really dig that there are bouldering specific gym's now and that new gym's like this still offer it all. Competitions are a lot of work, but a lot of reward. Something 25-50% of gym's choose not to do for a variety of reasons. ACG had a comp almost immediately, showcasing this brand new facility. These guys are on a facebook media blasting tear doing more for marketing than I've ever seen done for any climbing gum. Oh technology and the internet. Good setting and maintenance is key to keeping people happy and safe. Testing limits and ego's. You'll find challenge and reward regardless of your skill level here. You couldn't find more friendly, honest and humble owners \u00a0and with gorilla strong climbers to newbies training here every day welcoming all with open arms, you'll find your place here. As soon as \u00a0have my surgery's to fix a few old climbing injuries I'll be back here training again.", "date": "9/20/2012"}

They have an auto lock belay system and the ropes are anchored to the ground for top rope climbing. The setup is great for climbers who can climb and still be belayed by someone smaller. It's also great for beginners (we had a 1st time climber) who've never climbed or belayed.The price is also great, $15 day pass which includes gear if you don't already have. There was a kids bday party while we were there but otherwise it wasn't busy which was great so we could get some good climbs in.My only complaint and why i took off one star was that the walls for the top rope climbs isn't a rock facade but boarding, at least it's decorated but yea aesthetically I would've wanted a rock look like the bouldering walls.

I can't say enough about how friendly and helpful these guys were so I'll keep it short. As soon as we walked in they were very friendly and willing to help. They really gave the whole place a warm feel. They were always around to offer and hand or advise about a route/problem if needed and they seemed like they genuinely wanted to help you. I think this positive attitude must be contagious because all of the people climbing in the gym were extremely nice as well. Everyone seemed to be talking to each other and helping out other climbers.As far as the gym is concerned. I would say that it definitely has a different vibe to it than most gyms I have climbed at and I think that is mostly due to the owners attitude and hands on approach to running their gym. It had a very communal/small gym feel to it, even though the route diversity was great and well spread out. The routes were fun and challenging. There was also a good variety of climbing style within the bouldering area and the rope sections. The different climbing styles offer bouldering, sport climbing, and top rope. There is also a section towards the back of the gym and around (a somewhat hidden) corner that offers more of a beginner top roping area.The pricing for the gym is amazing also. $15 for a day pass and that included shoe rentals and harness rentals if you don't already have them. This is nice because most gyms charge additional (small) fees for the rental of shoes or harnesses. I was able to bring my friend who had just started climbing and since he didn't have any climbing equipment yet, he really appreciated that he got to save a little more than usual.Overall, I would definitely say that this gym was not quite as polished as some other gyms I've been to, but it covered all the basics and then some. Also, the community that it already seems to be establishing sets the bar above other local gyms. The owners approach to running their gym is amazing. I can only hope that this is something that is carried on permanently and not a short term means to make a good first impression.Try this place out! chances are you will end up loving it like I did.", "date": "9/10/2012"}
