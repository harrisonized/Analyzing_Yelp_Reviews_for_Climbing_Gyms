Really, customer service is not dead Ryen and Alex are there to prove it. The facility it self. \u00a0Went here recently with a friend, had a blast! What a great way to workout and have fun. We were treated so nicely by Ryen, she took the time to really explain how to properly belay and top rope with my partner, which we are both complete noobs, even going up herself and I was her partner on the ground so that I could gain the confidence of how it felt. Ryen then explained all the different levels of climbs around the gym. Which helped, because its huge with climbs of all variance all over. She had our best interest at the top, sharing a passion for climbing and spreading the joy thereof into the customers. \u00a0Basically we weren't just given some 5min explanation and sent out to fiddle fumble. I enjoyed it so much I returned with my children a few days later and signed up a membership with Alex. Talk about above and beyond. Alex took the time to explain the basics of the membership and perks at all three locations. While I was climbing with my kids, he would come around and offer guidance to all patrons including my daughter. I'm sure he could tell she was a bit timid at 5yrs old. He had a great way of being relatable with her and helping her enjoy herself more. Alex then took the time to give me my Top Rope certification and tutorial. He made sure I was versed in the figure 8 and ATC usage. Enough to were I confidently tied in my daughter and sent her up. At the end both Alex and Ryen were there and they both gave me an opportunity to top rope as they were my belayers (not sure if a word) while my children watched daddy go high!All in all, Alex and Ryan have made and continue to make my visits memorable and personal. If I haven't already said it, they are the definition of taking care of your clients. On belay, belay on. Climbing, climb on!", "date": "11/18/2018"}

Came here with a girlfriend who recently got the membership with another one of her friends and got to get a free belay lesson along with rental gear. The belay lesson was v helpful. Learning the basics of belaying - how to strap yourself correctly and see that your partner does the same if you have one. We were there for about 2 hours.I got the thrill of climbing up...but the hardest part for me was trusting in the other person in coming down. It's just hard to let go. I managed to successfully do it, but it is still a fear of mine to let go.For beginners, the easiest would be the 5.5. As the numbers go up, it gets harder. And there aren't many easy ones to train on besides two walls which you could use any shape to climb up, the 5.5 and the 5.6 (the auto-belay) in the front.Lots of parking, not too bad of a drive if you live in Poway, plus its a few blocks away from In-n-Out too! My girlfriend E said that this location definitely was bigger than the other Vertical Hold locations.Bouldering is also available but a bit scarier as you don't have a rope securing you. But they have cushions around to break your fall. Overall, had a good experience, and I hope to go more often next year as this year, all my weekends are booked", "date": "10/4/2018"}

Overall, definitely worth the money.It had been a while since I rock climbed, and my boyfriend had never done top rope, so the lesson was much needed! Aria[?] helped us with this and she was very friendly and made sure we understood the process. It seems like there is only 2 staff members at any given time, or at least when we went. This was not an issue for us since we went on our own to climb after the lesson, but once families came in, I noticed children were freely running around whose parents may not have been able to keep an eye on them 24/7. That might be dangerous, but nothing went wrong during our time here.The facility had a good amount of climbing routes, as well as two bouldering areas - one had routes that could go up and over the top! They also have 2 auto-belay ropes I believe. They also have a small gym area with equipment for basic exercises, a slack line, some rock climbing/finger holds to practice on, and a ping pong table too!

Once we got all of our gear, we weren't offered any assistance although asked if it was any of our first times, so I was definitely lucky to be with friends who have gone before. I did notice another beginner who came in and asked for some help as it was her first time. No biggie, just ask for some help if you need it. It was about $24 for shoe/gear rental and for rock climbing. I'd say definitely worth it! They do have year passes and they also hold yoga and a mini gym!

From what I've heard they have changed management awhile ago. I used to go to Solid Rock during my high school years but now I want to get back into rock climbing again, so here I am!Since it's a different management, the reviews are cleared, my advice is not to base this place heavily on just reviews (even mine, haha!) and try it out yourself! But as always I'll give you my personal experience with Vertical Hold.Perks: Parking is great. As it is in a quiet business district so there is NO noise whatsoever. It's close to the private gym I go to so I can just drive 2 minutes down the road to climb so it's very convenient for me. But, this place has a gym which you can use if you have a membership I believe. The gym has a variety of machines to make all kinds of gains but I just prefer the gym I go to now! They have two really good bouldering sections and plenty, plenty of top roping areas for your enjoyment, with difficulties up to 5.10(+) and for bouldering V10(+); a range from beginners to the 'elites'. There are empty rooms around the building for party hosting and events! The last time I went there was a party and all the boys were running around trying to climb anything they can. It's not as busy when I usually go (9 am, 2-5 pm). At night when I was passing by it definitely looks more crowded so if you don't like forcing social interactions definitely go during 'work' hours!Customer Service: In my opinion it's pretty good. For my schedule I usually come and climb early, early as in when it JUST opens, 9 am! Lucilo was there to help and got me registered for my membership. He was really nice and I finished the procedure quickly and got my free Vertical Hold shirt and free rentals for a month! \u00a0He also gave me a free complementary belay lesson so I can relearn everything I thought I forgot years ago. I've been going when I can with my busy schedule and he's always there to help me. The other staff I haven't talked to, as I just get occasional stares. I'm not going to assume they have an attitude or anything as I would love to have conversations with all of the staff which will probably happen eventually! But Lucilo would always greet me and say hello whenever he notices I'm there, so a shout out for him for sure! :)For the many times I have been there, I've personally had a great experience.
