I'm glad I did. :)Pros: routes are re-set on a regular basis, so there is always something relatively new to work on. Their holds aren't all polished and slick, they mix up route-styles (I LOVE volumes... and crimps) and every re-set, the routes are significantly different, not just a different iteration of the last set. Staff is cool, dogs are allowed, and they have a nice selection of snacks/drinks. I also like that aside from their monthly membership fee and initial i.d. card fee, there are no other hidden fees. I go so often that May has pretty much already paid for itself.Cons: Umm... I think the biggest annoyance for me is that some people who climb there don't know basic etiquette, like starting a climb when there is someone climbing above them. Also, this may be nit-picky and a personal preference but it also makes me cringe when people just drop down like rocks from the top and they land really heavily. I always hope that they looked down before they let go, cuz if they fell on someone/something it would not be pretty.This place can get really crowded in the evenings. Sometimes it's good (if the crowd is good, y'know, supportive, friendly, not trying to out-climb each other but working together), but sometimes it gets so crowded that it is hard to really climb what you want, especially if it traverses or if it's a popular-or-new route.

It's been a while since I've actually gone back to this location, but I was pleasantly surprised today when they were offering a class which incorporated various types of training. Michelle was an awesome trainer, and I'm looking forward to more classes with her as well as other members of the team :-) hopefully I'll be able to keep building my endurance and my strength as I continue to train during these classes that they offer. I love that both locations are dog friendly, and I was really excited to see one of the resident dogs. I think I'll be bringing mine relatively soon to introduce him to the other friends at the gym.

For non-members, it's $10 per person per visit, for which you receive a day pass bracelet. (Though if you're brand new to Vital, your first visit is free, rentals and everything!)It's very small, compared to other climbing gyms I've been to, but provides a warm and friendly atmosphere. I would say that Vital is more suitable to those who are beginners at bouldering, since the size of the place is less intimidating (versus, say, Bay Area's Planet Granite). There's enough variety within the same grade of difficulty to allow for steady progress -- I completed a couple VB's and V0's with few problems, but several V0's that involved a change in terrain definitely posed a challenge to me. I resolved to make those particular V0's my projects. Gotta conquer one path at a time!Another great thing about Vital is that you'll see a wide range of people there bouldering, including tiny kids (whom you'll secretly loathe because they're clearly more agile than you'll ever be) and hardcore enthusiasts (whom you'll also loathe because they're dyno-ing while you're stuck on the wall, trying your damnedest to reach a handhold that's just one inch too far to the left). But seriously, everyone is friendly and the more experienced boulderers are happy to help -- super useful when your technique is rough (or nonexistent), like mine. Especially since Vital doesn't have a technique-focused practice wall for traversing different kinds of handholds and footholds, like the one at the Vertical Hold gym.I didn't make use of the lounge area upstairs, but it looks like a cozy place to chill and relax after a hard day's climb. As others have said, there's a small coffee bar, which is right next to the bathroom (unisex and, most importantly, clean).The only complaint I have is that Vital does not offer size 6.5 shoes for rental. I tried to make do with size 6 (since size 7 was too loose to be safe), but after a couple climbs, my feet started screaming in protest. So I popped out to REI, bought my own shoes, and came back. Maybe not a lot of customers are size 6.5, but still, if a place is in the business of serving climbers, it should always have their size available, no matter how popular. I mean, they already showed up at your gym, ready to go. How the hell else are they supposed to climb?(Note: all the rental shoes are velcro-strapped. If you prefer laced shoes, you must bring your own. Also, this place is a bit hard to find, as it doesn't have a sign. You'll want to drive towards the back, where -- if I recall correctly -- it's located next to a dance studio.)", "date": "11/15/2011"}
