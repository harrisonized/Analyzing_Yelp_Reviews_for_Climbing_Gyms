My four year old daughter wanted to rock climb for the first time, and we went to Boulderdash not knowing what to do or expect but wanting to help her to try something she was interested in. The extremely professional staff accommodated us on the fly. My daughter became afraid once it was time to climb. But Cat took time to quickly and gently build a rapport with my daughter, and ever-patiently worked as her belay to help her make it to the top. My daughter left feeling accomplished and more confident thanks to Cat's positivity and encouragement. The facility (including the bathroom) is extremely clean. Plenty of space, great lighting, and a stimulating array of climb options. While we were there, we saw kids and parents, couples, novices, and advanced climbers. Lots of smiles everywhere. Great, positive atmosphere. Whether you've rock climbed before or not, Boulderdash is a must-visit.

They dont have the most basic equipment most gyms have..Except in the crossfit area, which costs an additional $20 a month on top of the very high member fee. I can understand paying extra for CLASSES but I can't use the unused space for open gym? How asinine when the reg gym isn't properly stocked. At 24 hr fitness i get all the equipment i need AND classes for half the price. Step it up diablo rock. Here's the issue they don't seem to understand. Crossfit hoards most of the equipment. You can't get realllyyy basic things in the regular gym. Like, a medicine ball/sand ball. We're rationed one. I hope you wanted 10lbs! Want a kettle bell? Well you get exactly 5 to choose from, hope you wanted super light or mega heavy! Want dumbells? Sure! We've got these awkward wide plate ones that are rusting from the 70's! Oh wait, did you want dumb bells lighter than 10lbs? Oh well go dig in that dusty old bucket, im sure youll find one random 8 lb and one 5lb. Hell, sometimes I can't even access the rowing machine because guess what? Crossfit takes that too sometimes! It's fine to say that this isn't a 24hr fitness, sure. But I'm constantly having to improvise my workouts here due to lack of equipment and to see the adequate equipment available but not accessible when membership is already $100+/month is completely uncalled for. They need to either properly stock the reg gym or let paying members access the equipment that, lets be real here, our memberships definitely paid for.\",\n",

Keep in mind that it has a very small bouldering area (the smallest of all the Touchstone gyms) and can get quite crowded during peak hours. They also rely on crash mats for climber safety, as opposed to the fat pad flooring that they have at Dogpatch and Ironworks. This can make falling or jumping down a little more hazardous for those used to the other gyms (I know one climber who recently missed the mat when coming down and suffered a slight ankle sprain). If you want to go bouldering, don't be afraid to move the mats around! There are a lot of routes for those looking to top rope.The workout area is pretty spacious and has a pool on site. The weights and machines are a little dated, but often free for those looking to get in a quick workout. Biggest downside is the parking, which can be quite difficult for those coming in the afternoon.\",\n",

Afterwards, we got to climb as many walls for as long as we wanted.Prices are a little steep (about $20 for a day pass on the weekends), but it's what you'd expect to pay for any single session at a yoga parlor or cycle place.My only qualm is that it kind of smells here, but it's expected with any gym.Other than that, this will most likely become our go-to gym for rock climbing.\",\n",

Our teacher was very patient and knowledgeable. She had us go through the motions a bunch of times until we were comfortable. I really liked how she would show us step by step, we would do the steps together, and then we would do it on our own a few times & she'd check each one of us! The lesson is like 30 minutes and then you get to climb. The teacher watched us and helped us when needed. She watched probably 2-3 climbs and then the class was over. After the class is over, you get a full day pass where you get to climb all day if you want. You can try all different levels, same levels in different locations, watch people, take breaks, etc. There's even other fun things to do like walk on a rope (whatever that's called), and other fun balance things. I really liked this place! It's for all ages. Little kids were there and older adults were there. All ages were having a blast. I got REALLY tired. My arms and body couldn't handle more than 4 hours lol but I'm sure others can. I definitely recommend this place! My sister and I really enjoyed it.

These indoor rock climbing gyms are such a treat to have. They are yet to come in Baton Rouge, LA so I was excited to visit this one. It was our first time there and I have never done rock climbing without the use of an auto-belay device. Unfortunately, since we did not receive any prior training we could not clime the higher walls here without doing a formal belay session. So, they gave us the option of bouldering, which was also really neat to do! My 7-year old daughter is obsessed with rock climbing and I enjoy it, too, but wish I had more upper body strength. It is hard! Bouldering was fun and has no belay, so you climb and either have to jump from the top or climb back down. I was exhausted and super sore afterwards. My daughter was into trying all the difficulty levels and enjoyed jumping off of the wall. For the record, I was super sore for a couple days, but totally worth it. Now, I am looking forward to the one opening up here in Baton Rouge! #climb\",\n",

It came out to be around $30 a person. The last time I had been rock climbing (not here) was about 3 years ago and I remember the class being very informative and slow paced...I mean you could really mess up in this sport so it should be. We started out with the class (this is what brought down the stars): A guy with a cap came over and gave us our harnesses, belay, and carabiner. He then proceeded to show us how to tie everything...super fast like we just needed a refresher. Uh, we are noobs, can you slow down? We were with another couple at the time who were first timers as well and we all had trouble keeping up. He acted very impatient every time we were slightly confused. After asking many questions and getting the same \"you should already know this\" attitude, we finally suited up and were ready to climb. The rest of the trip wasn\\'t that bad. They had many levels from easy to extremely difficult climbs. We tried all the easy to medium ones with the latter being good challenges for us. They also had a tightrope for you to try if you were feeling adventurous, which we were. Although, there are other gyms that are much bigger in comparison, this one was a decent size and you could easily spent 3 hours here.All in all, if we were there to just climb without the lessons, I could go again. I have to just keep practicing in the air with how to tie the ropes so I don\\'t forget and can pass the test. Not having to deal with the people who work there every time would be best. Otherwise, I\\'d definitely pick somewhere else if you were just starting.',\n",

I was in last week with a friend and noticed the prices that had been posted and the day rate is going from $20 to $25. Seriously a 25% increase in a daily rate, which does not include shoes or any gear. Thankfully I have my own gear otherwise I would be about $30 bucks just to climb for a little while.. Also, the monthly rate seems to go up 2 bucks a year, so I guess that is to be expected. I have always had my gripes with gyms and their initiation fees. Really a $100 for someone to plug in some data entry? Outside of my nickel and diming complaints the gym is very well equipped. More than adequate climbing areas and a solid workout room. Lots of classes and workout styles that are accommodated. In the last almost decade here I have met so many good friends and made so many memories. The service is amazing with super friendly and helpful staff and solid amenities I will keep it a 4 and ding it the one star for the shortsighted pricing policy though.Update:Hans from the gym let me know that the day rate had not changed in like 5 years and that the initiation fee is waived during the month of January.',\n",

They still provide great routes that is challenging for all levels! It can get a bit crowded though, especially in the evenings and weekends, but it's not that bad. I also love the staff members here, they're all very chill and very helpful. Feels a bit on the slow side, but for some reason, it doesn't bother me. Probably because the music is so hypnotizing and the general atmosphere is super relaxed. The bathrooms here are very nice and clean and VERY EMPTY. I'm pretty sure I could go butt naked in here for a good hour and nobody would know. They also provide nice smelling shampoo, conditioner and body wash as well as blow dryers and brushes (pretty dirty though). I think they also provide towels, but I always bring my own anyway so who knows.\",\n",

This can be very frustrating and I wish they'd do this during their off hours.If it wasn't for the large amounts of kids running around at times, and the resetting of the gym during climbing hours I would give this place 5 stars.\",\n",

I checked out Diablo for the first time and I was pleasantly surprised. Definitely a fan!From the outside, I was skeptical. The building didn't look very big, and while the walls aren't as tall as some of the other gyms, the number of routes for both bouldering and top-roping are actually pretty substantial. The gym also packs in a decent weight room/cardio equipment, a pool (!!), a dry and a wet sauna, plus exercise classes + a Crossfit gym as well. This is definitely one of the more all-inclusive gyms of the Touchstone family. The staff members here are great too. I didn't get a sort of pretentious/arrogant vibe that I've felt at a couple of the other gyms. My guest had shoes but needed a harness. The woman at the front desk comped the harness which I definitely appreciated. His belay test went smoothly as well and she was great about giving him some pointers. Overall, a super positive experience. If I'm ever back in the area, I'll definitely be back.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'My daughter was interested in rock climbing for her Bday, I was very excited to have found somewhere near that we can go to. I looked at your website & saw good reviews. We are all new to rock climbing and your facility, so we even went to check the gym before booking the party. And that\\'s when I actually first noticed the poor customer service at your front desk. I had questions with the prices and how things worked if I wanted a party. Basically, left your gym that night saying to one of your front desk people: \"Should I just look at your website?\" Because honestly, he made me feel that he did not have time to answer my questions. A few days passed, since my daughter really wanted to rock climb for her Bday, I went ahead & called to book the party over the phone. I had a few questions first, coz again we are new to your facility & are not sure on how things work. Well, this is how it ended..I said: \"You know what, I\\'ll just book the party on line.\" Why? Because as I was trying to ask & talk to this someone on the phone, he was talking to someone else! I almost did not want to book the party there anymore at this point.Today...today was the day of the party. I already had an idea of what may go wrong, but I was hoping it would be different. Unfortunately, it was not. Our party was 4-6pm..I was told we are able to use the party room at this slot even though you don\\'t offer it at this time on Sunday\\'s. I came a little early @ 3:45pm to check in. We were checked in by JP or PJ. I asked if we are able to set up in the party room & he said there\\'s a party that is still there & to check back in about 10 minutes. We check back at 3:55pm & asked someone else if the room was ready...JP or PJ annoyingly shouts \"I already checked them in!\" I had to step away because I did not want to loose it in front of my children and her guests. My husband finally spoke to an older gentleman & we were told that the room is being cleaned, but for the meantime the girls could start climbing. Katie was the girls instructor and if it weren\\'t for her, my daughter\\'s experience would\\'ve been really awful. Katie was awesome! (She is the the reason for the 1 star) Thanks to Katie or else it would\\'ve gotten really bad. The whole time that the girls were climbing, guess what happened to the party room? No one ever bothered to come up to me or my husband to follow up on it. We had our cooler, snacks & decorations for the room by the sofa waiting. I just told my husband to take everything to the car & forget it! If it weren\\'t for one of your other staff over hearing me complain to my older sister about talking to the manager that someone finally talked to us. This was already probably 5:45pm! JP or PJ came out to apologize to my husband, but for what?! It was already done!!Improve your customer service at your front desk. Teach them just simple common courtesy. Teach them that they can\\'t assume that not every person that walks in your gym is supposed to know what to do! I asked for climbing shoes for one of my daughter\\'s guests & I get a snarky comment that her shoes is as good to use. I know that! She preferred climbing shoes! JP or PJ rolls his eyes and basically drops the shoes like he did not want to give it to us! Ask him if he heard anything from me?! I\\'m a very patient person, but I could\\'ve really lost it there at that point. I\\'m an adult & your staff are all kids! They are hanging out there in front, flipping their hairs & acting like they can\\'t be bothered! Please.. my daughter loved the experience climbing with Katie. I am really considering signing up so she is able to do more climbing. But if your front desk staff is not going to improve, I\\'ll take my business somewhere else & soon other people would too. For the record, I am not complaining so that we can get free classes or a refund. Ask PJ or JP(whatever his name was!), because he did offer that to my husband. Unfortunately, this experience earned you this review.',\n",

Writing as a pure beginner.My SO and I came on a Sunday midday for an introductory climbing class and hung around after to play around. We were really happy with our experience. The intro class is effectively $5 on top of admission and gear rental, which signified to us that the gym puts value on safety. The class was small (5 people) and the instructor made sure everyone was competent by the end.The climbing itself was fun and challenging, but approachable and addicting. There is a bouldering pit, top rope area, and lead climbing area. My guess is that this is a rather small gym, but from a beginner's perspective, it was plenty big.

I'd recommend this place for ages 8 and up (depending how confident and how afraid of heights they are).My first visit here was ok. The parking lot is pretty small, but there's usually spaces available. (Tip; Sky High is around the corner). When you 1st enter, there are leather couches to sit in. If you are a 1st timer, pop a squat (Big Brother Season 14xD) and fill out your application. I would NOT recommend this place for people who do not have medical insurance. The place itself is pretty small too. There are about 4 rock walls, a gym (for 18 years of age or older NO KIDS ALLOWED, and a bouldering wall section (climbing without harnesses). The rock walls itself are based on levels. The higher the level, the higher it is. New rock climbers should start off on an lower level so they can get more confident.The place is really nice, but it's not that much for me. You see, I'm a tiny bit afraid of heights and I can't climb high so this place doesn't get me a lot of hours of exercise. At the front, there is a counter where you can buy (energy) snacks & soda. I had a cookie there which was ok. The food is on display and sits there, so obviously it's not fresh. \\xa0Next to it is a tiny gift shop wear you can buy gear and stuff.

My raw strength and determination to conquer each set was exhilarating. Though my hands and toes felt like they were bleeding afterwards I want to go back and try the harder levels. For a beginner, I held my own but had great support from other members. Everyone there was very nice and eager to assist. If you want to get away from being an autopilot drone with headphones on a treadmill you can also try cross fit, yoga, cardio and free weights besides climbing. The neighboring aquatic club partners with Diablo for their members to come and swim or take classes. Truly and an all inclusion workout center. Can't wait to go back!\",\n",

       "  'text': 'It is difficult to rate this Gym using yelps star system \\xa0 Let me explain. I used this gym for 3 months and it started out being everything I wanted/needed.I would get to the gym at 6:am and all the machines were always available, the atmosphere was relatively quite, the music was good and watching people do the various activities, like rock climbing and cross fit, just added a sense of community to the gym. \\xa0 \\xa0The staff is friendly and over all, things were just fine. \\xa0 I had been thinking about getting my kids to come with me and do some of the rock climbing courses the gym offers. \\xa0 I\\'m glad we never made it to that point. My bad experience begins one day when I start to notice people peeling calloused skin off their palms after they rock climb. \\xa0Hey, its a rock climbing gym, it\\'s going to happen right? \\xa0 However, I never really thought of that being an issue until I noticed some people doing it. \\xa0 \\xa0I began to realize that \"duh\" \\xa0people are going to blister from time to time while climbing these rock walls, but then what happens. \\xa0 \\xa0Well, over the course of a week or so, \\xa0I noticed some of these rock climbers who are peeling their palms were using the free weights after their morning climbing. \\xa0 \\xa0This made me question how clean the bars and weights were. \\xa0 \\xa0It just so happened that one morning, during my workout, I went to grab a barbell from the barbell stand and there it was....two chalky palm prints on the bar, the left one with sticky darkened red ooze covering exactly where the index and middle finger would join the palm. \\xa0 And the barbell below it, the same thing. \\xa0 \\xa0I started looking at all the barbells there. \\xa0 All of them have traces of chalk on them, and all of them have dark spotted areas on them similar to what the bloodied one looked like it was drying into. \\xa0 I decided in those brief moments that I was done at this gym and later that day I came back to sign my notice to quit. \\xa0 I did not give my true reason for leaving them then, I just did not want to hear an excuse or a sales pitch on their part trying to get me to stay. \\xa0 I was disgusted and just wanted to leave. \\xa0I reviewed their website afterwords and on the bottom left hand corner of their site there was a gallery with a picture of two calloused hands slightly bleeding. \\xa0That picture is not there as of this writing, but only a few short months ago it was. \\xa0 \\xa0 Which should have set off an alarm to me earlier if I had more thoroughly check their website before I signed up. So, to finish this off, again my 3 star review is complicated. \\xa0I give the place 5 stars for the type of gym that it is.5 stars on amenities, 4 stars on friendliness4 stars on my overall experience minus the callous picking and blood incident.And what can the Gym do to prevent people from lifting weights with blistered hands? \\xa0 \\xa0 I don\\'t know. \\xa0 I suspect blistering hands are just part \\xa0of the rock climbing culture both on real rock and fake rock. \\xa0 \\xa0It\\'s gonna happen, \\xa0 but somehow people need to be accountable for their own hygiene when handling the equipment. \\xa0 And I left because I don\\'t believe this is something that the gym can ever completely control. I think it falls under the idea that everything a customer does there, is done at their own risk. \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0And I choose to not take part in that risk. \\xa0 \\xa0Good Luck.',\n",

       "  'text': \"I started climbing in Austria where I learned belaying and techniques. The gym I used to go to in Austria has much higher walls (about 3-4x the height of Diablo's) so the lower walls at Diablo are extremely disappointing. I don't feel as though I'm getting endurance training at all. My main issue however is that the staff at Diablo have an air about them like they're better than everyone. The one female staff member I've encountered has been very nice, but the male staff is intolerable. They need an attitude adjustment. Also, I don't know how familiar the staff is with climbing itself. It seems as though they are well trained in the Touchstone style of climbing but have no idea what other belaying devices are. At Touchstone they seem to only use GriGris and they expect people to treat other belaying devices the exact same way. I am confident in my belaying as I have been doing it many many times as well as fall training...NEVER have I ever let my partner fall to the ground. Touchstone gym members, however, are extremely bad at belaying. I'm sorry to say but your rigorous testings prove nothing; my belaying partner has complained that while belaying me, some other people fell on him. This is unacceptable. And I do think this is the gym's fault, since they've been teaching people how to belay. I've never seen this happen in the gym I go to in Austria, because the staff actually knows proper techniques and how to properly teach. So while I am an excellent belayer, because I don't use the same belaying technique, I have not been given a belay card (rather I get the 1-day passes) because the staff doesn't know what they're doing. It is extremely annoying. I will still go to the gym because it is the only one in the area but only because I'm desperate to climb.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'So Disappointing.This review is based on the overall experience. Our 11 year old son, after a previous visit to this gym, requested his birthday party be kept at this place. We called the Gym in advance to reserve, and were told that the reservation can only be done online and assured us it is easy, safe and secured (questionable). Setup the reservation online paying the deposit, and when we called the day before the event to ask questions regarding bringing in the pizza and cake, we were told \"There is NO reservation!\", and that there is nothing that can be done at this time. We had invited 16 kids to come from Lafayette and had no place to go. After calling back, the reservation was found, however made at Fresno Gym. We never inquired about any other locations and made the reservation on their site without getting any options to choose a different location. Now that the reservation was found, we are told that we still cannot come because they do not have staff. We offered to do ropes and we were told to come late that day for training. Once the staff part was resolved, we were told that they do not have a room to do the party in. After insisting for awhile, they offered their yoga classroom. Once we saw it we understood their hesitation... The room was smelling terrible and felt dirty and the chairs they provided looked like they were retrieved from a garbage bin as well as not enough of them. Dirty, ugly looking, or even smaller size. We had to ask for someone to do something about that smell so that we can bring the kids and have them fed. The check in process was slow, unpleasant and disorganized. We were embarrassed in front of the parents dropping of their children but for the staff it seemed normal. Most kids in our party within the hour and a half provided, they did the claim once or twice due to the overcrowding and long wait times. We were not at ease with the instructors that told 8-10 year old kids to claim the big boulders without the ropes. Three instructors were supposed to be assigned to our group, however we only saw one active and assumed that two other ones were talking to each other by the smaller boulders intended for the younger kids. Most staff was unpleasant to talk to or was talking to the kids in a \"somewhat rude\" and inpatient manner without explaining what was that they did wrong.The amount of stress that this particular part of our son\\'s birthday celebration put on us was not worth the little fun the Gym provides. We believe it may be a great place to work out or claim but by no means they are ready or willing to host and welcome a group of kids coming all at once.',\n",

I perused the website before I went, and somehow I found it comforting to know that the place is associated with Mission Cliffs in SF, the mecca of IRC in the bay. It was Sunday morning. Lovie and I decided to try it together, though I've been once before. As newbies, we opted for the intro course just so lovie can learn how to tie the knots and belay me so neither of us would fall 50 feet down. The class was longer than usual, but necessary. The place itself is super clean....from the layout of the area down to their restrooms. It wasn't too crowded in the morning, but as the day wore on, people started to fill in. They have an awesome bouldering area as well where you can pull up a mat and start climbing like Spiderman without a rope. It is significantly smaller than Mission Cliffs, but I guess the size is sufficient for the area they're serving.I had a really good experience here. If ever I get a hankering to rock climb again in the future, I'll be heading to this place.Rock solid!\",\n",

As far as indoor climbing gyms go, this is one of the best I\\'ve been to.If you go with zero knowledge on how to belay or tie in, don\\'t fret - you can get a lesson from one of the DRG Staff members for a charge. Bonus - they\\'ll stay with you and watch you work until they\\'re comfortable with your skill level.For the intermediate to advanced climber, the multi-pitched routes and lead routes are awesome, insane, and physically demanding. Your forearms will hate you for it. These routes are set by a professional team of route setters whose only job is to - you guessed it - set routes.It\\'s been described as \"thinky\" and \"interesting\" by climbing enthusiasts the world around, so you really can\\'t go wrong with this joint. For the beginner, it\\'s all good for you, too. There\\'s an entire wall that is just jam-packed with beginner routes, but these tend to get a bit crowded when there are large groups of people present.DRG is also a great place to bring kids and have a party, as they provide services where DRG Staff members will belay for all of your little rugrats as they scurry up the walls like little monkeys.Finally, if you\\'re a loner, the bouldering area is just rife with crazy routes that\\'ll make you hate yourself in the morning.',\n",

The next night, Esco and Heather, who\\'d missed the night before, took me to Diablo Rock - their \"home\" gym - so I was very excited.This is a really nice Touchstone gym, probably just a little smaller in size than Sacramento Pipeworks, and not as tall from what I can tell, but the same close and cozy atmosphere and style. The route setting here makes up for a lack in altitude with attitude; climbs are sequenced laterally as much as vertically, exercising traversal movement that isn\\'t often tested in more vertical routes.The same care and attention to safety can be found here; I tested for my belay and THANKFULLY finally earned my permanent belay card!So we climbed. \\xa0I finished a 35-foot 5.8, \"Buenos Aires\", and ascended most of a 5.9, \"Porto Novo\"; as with its other gyms, Touchstone setters name its routes, sometimes thematically - a series of car names, engineering terms, tropical getaways, etc.. While being a smaller gym, the place was relatively empty for 8pm on a Wednesday evening, giving us our pick and choose of all the available routes. \\xa0And the quiet is peaceful. \\xa0So whether it was me lurching about one-legged, Esco fluidly flowing upward in focus\\'d silence, or Heather weightlessly bounding skyward while talking to us below about her day, its a comfortable environment.The bouldering area is particularly compact, but with enough features, overhangs, pitches that it looks engaging. \\xa0And I\\'ve always found Touchstone boulder problems intense, especially for their brevity (they looks shorter than the bouldering walls at PG).Definitely coming back here! \\xa0Especially when it means being/visiting nearby familia and loved ones!_______________________________Climbers are very supportive and endearing towards their injured fellows. When I reached the top of my first route, air-boot\\'d leg dangling aside, a nearby couple said \"Duuude, you\\'re crazy, but that\\'s awesome!\"',\n",

Intermediate problems are set with a bit more care, but make no mistake, this is not a bouldering gym. The fitness area is extensive, but not very climbing specific. There's no campus board, and the only hangboard is gross/dirty and has to be manually hung over a bar to use it (sounds weird but it's actually quite stable).

The walls are high, and some of the routes are challenging, I think I got up to the the high 5.11's. \\xa0Maybe 5.11abc or d. \\xa0I can't remember. \\xa0Maybe even some 5.12's on a good day. \\xa0Plus, after getting to know everyone, I felt like I had my own coaches, everyone supported everyone else, always cheering me on.Not to mention the classes. \\xa0I used to take an ABs class a few times a week. \\xa0And even yoga sometimes! \\xa0 Plus, there's all kinds of regular gym equipment and weights and stuff.Oh, I miss Touchstone and I miss climbing. \\xa0*sigh* \\xa0I still have all my gear, so if you need a climbing partner and you have a buddy pass... hit me up!!\",\n",

However, I do know that they change up the climbing routes frequently, because I have seen them doing so on several occasions.I joined this gym because it does not have the 'meat market' mentality of other gyms in the area. I was impressed by the distinct lack of 'gym bunnies' and 'muscle heads' who seem to do little more than take up space and waste everybody's time. It has a great selection of cardio equipment, exercise machines and free weights. The yoga classes are fantastic! I also try to take advantage of the steam room every chance I get. Definitely worth the money, and what was the final selling point was the fact that they don't lock you in to a 'contract' like so many other places do.\",\n",

I will definitely be driving a little further to visit a better gym next time, as my experience here was like none other I\\'ve had at any rock gym. The woman with the accent working the front desk was horribly rude. She told us we needed to pass a belay test to climb so we had to wait about 15 minutes as she tested someone else then went back to sitting at the front desk and didn\\'t even acknowledge us at the testing ropes. No \"be right with you\" or anything. So she finally comes to test us and was Shockley rude and condescending and was treating us as if we are completely dumb. Which is funny because we are definitely seasoned climbers so it\\'s pretty frustrating to have to test for this anyways. So after \"testing\" (talking down to us) one of us on belay she mumbles something, leaves and goes back to talking on the phone. We stood for another five minutes before I was just ready to hop on a rope and forget about this stupid test when finally another one of the staff just gave us our test passed cards and agreed that his coworker was \"kind of dumb\" so definitely warning all my climb friends in the Bay Area to not waste their time or money with this one.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Diablo Rock Gym is the place I call home for my fitness needs, so deep down I love it - but this is an unbiased view from a relatively new climber - I\\'ve been a member of Touchstone for 3 months now. First off 90% of the time this place is pretty peaceful. There are a lot of route options for belay, lead and bouldering, with ranges in difficulty that will suit any level climber (5.2 is the lowest I\\'ve seen). The walls are shorter than the other Touchstone locations, but personally I like that because I\\'m still building muscle. The staff is great about regularly cycling the routes to keep things new and exciting. Great overhang on both the lead wall and the bouldering wall, even though I\\'m still too novice to touch them. Overall it\\'s a fantastic gym - very open and inviting. I\\'ve never had a problem getting a weight/cardio machine even at peak hours of the day. Never have to wait for belay routes. Never have to wait for boulder routes. They offer classes every day (Yoga, Cycle, & Zumba) though I haven\\'t checked any of them out yet (not big on classes). It\\'s just a great place to get in, do your thing, shower, and go home. The staff are all very friendly and helpful. Bonus for me that it\\'s 5 minutes from my house.Now the cons, because every place has them... Luckily there are only two, both of which I consider tolerable. The biggest \"meh\" I have with DRG is that it seems like they run a babysitting service from at least 4:45pm (when I usually arrive) until about 7-ish. During the week there\\'s quite often a group of kids running around with one or two young guys monitoring them - MOST of the time. I\\'ve honestly had kids from that group climb up bouldering routes that criss-cross with mine first being below me and then above me (they\\'re so quick!) to the \\xa0point where I have to pause my course because I don\\'t want to have one of them fall/jump on me or vice versa. They often socialize at the bottom of belay climbs just swinging on the ropes (not climbing), or tear around the gym at high speeds. I understand it\\'s the suburbs, but I\\'m there to work out, not to dodge children. There should be a level of maturity in these kids, otherwise they shouldn\\'t be in a gym in the first place.The only other issue I\\'ve had is that the showers don\\'t seem to get very hot. I don\\'t need scalding, but something that is above lukewarm would be nice. I\\'ve been in the shower with it on as hot as it will go and still had goosebumps, and that\\'s no good when all I want to do is wash the sweat out of my hair - I should have enough heat for a 7 minute shower that won\\'t leave me shivering.Other than those two small issues, Concord is great, and even if these situations remain the same I will continue to go there because the pros of diverse and mostly available climbs/machines, relative tranquility, and proximity to my house definitely outweigh the random unruly children and less than hot showers.',\n",

       "  'text': \"I've been a member here for over a year now, and I love it. Friendly staff, good yoga classes and very social crowd, for the most part. I've been able to pick up random climbing buddies after hanging out in the bouldering pit a while, but on days when I don't want to talk to anyone and just want to climb, I can do that too. Towel service, steam room, sauna, pro shop (SNACKS!! need more calories to burn!), and plenty of folks around to help give tips and suggestions make this a good place to learn to climb. Seems like there's always a group of Boy Scouts, a birthday party, or multi-generational family group there in the afternoons and evenings, but the mornings are pretty quiet and calm if you prefer that. As of March 2011 they just got in new rental shoes, which is nice. Better to get your own if you want to stick to the walls on a regular basis, though. Oh yeah... REI is practically across the street (Willow Pass Road), so you can do that pretty easily. Check out their rope and bouldering competitions throughout the year, and get a membership so you can check out all the other Touchstone gyms. Totally worth it. I started out as a rookie last year, and between all the climbing and yoga I've done there, I feel fantastic.\",\n",

The fact that you can come in, get your rock climbing shoes if you don't have any, and either boulder or rock climb \\xa0all you want is something that is great about this gym. You can work on the machines (elliptical, treadmill, etc.) of course, but just the environment is nice. Small, isolated gym, but worth traveling to. I'm not a fan of gyms because of the many kinds of people that go there who are very vain. Here? You don't get that vibe. Everybody is doing their thing and not worried about what you do which is nice when you sometimes want to try something new without you having that feeling that others may be judging you.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Let me be clear about what I\\'m writing about: the claim that they have a POOL... that you can swim in. \\xa0I wanted to give them a try because they offered a pool.... well if you can call it a pool. \\xa0No doubt the rock climbing part of the gym looks fantastic, but if you want to swim - you are better off in your bathtub. \\xa0The locker rooms that have the steam / sauna / showers and lockers are NOT attached to the \"pool\". \\xa0In order to get to the locker rooms where you can change before going to the \"pool\" you have to walk through the entirety of the gym - around the weights section, through some doors, around the \"pool\" - then into a hallway that has a men\\'s restroom sign. \\xa0At first I couldn\\'t believe that this was the locker room for the pool. \\xa0Upon entering it turns out I was half right. \\xa0It was the place where the gym owners expect you to change and shower if you are using the pool, but it was NO locker room. \\xa0The List: \\xa0the lights half work and then turn off on you after 5 minutes (only way to get them to turn back on it to go back to the door and wave your hand at the sensor), even with the lights on the toilet had NO light, the VAST majority of the lockers are broken with no way to actually lock them, the few lockers that work are on the bottom and in the corner, the \"shower\" is a hole in the wall with no curtain (looked as though it had one of those shower heads that spray ice cold water at you with speeds that could pierce skin or that it would just trickle out), the whole hole smelt like mold and a homeless persons dirty socks. Now lets move onto the main event... the \"pool\". \\xa0If you are a swimmer and by swimmer I mean someone who swims... not someone who swims a lap or two and then lallygags for one end to the other - this \"pool\" is NOT for You! \\xa0It is perhaps the dingiest thing I have seen in a great while. \\xa0The entire \"pool\" is 3 ft-ish deep. \\xa0I\\'m 6\\'2\" and when I swim I don\\'t like my fingers hitting the bottom, and although I am flexible and can get pretty compact during a flip turn, the water level is such that it is not sufficient enough for me to do one. To sum up the whole experience including the entire look of the \"pool\" SAD SAD & SAD!! Probably the WORST pool I\\'ve swam in since moving to CA. I\\'m sorry I wasted the money on the month of unlimited swimming.',\n",
