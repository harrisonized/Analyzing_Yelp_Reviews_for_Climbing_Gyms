Also, you can tell the equipment is pretty dated and there were places were you can see plywood covering certain areas up. Since it is on the smaller side, when it gets crowded, it can get tight and longer wait times. 4 stars for having keg every 1st week of the month so you can drink and climb. I also think it's more of an affordable option compared to some of the other climbing gyms nearby. Everyone is pretty hospitable and the environment is super laid back, informal which I can always appreciate! It's worth checking out - Climb on\"},\n",

In comparison with some other climbing gyms I've been to, nothing quite matches the quality of the customer service, the challenging fun routes, and the community of folks who boulder at ACG. The staff/owners - Trevor, Brent and Dillon are all really friendly and open to giving pointers and safety tips. I have only had positive and friendly encounters with them (and also with their cute doggie)! Some of the climbers here say that the routes at ACG are more difficult than some other gyms in the area (i.e. a v1 at ACG is a v2 elsewhere). Part of that might be due to the fact that some of their bouldering walls are taller, enabling the route setters to create longer (and more interesting as a result) routes. Another cool aspect of the gym is that the people who boulder here are so chill. You can openly ask for advice on how to send a particular route you are having trouble with and most of the time, people will try to help you out.\"},\n",

Towards the end of our stay we did have to be more mindful of where we were climbing and had to wait for our turns. \\xa0But the gym itself seemed very friendly and a great place to climb with friends. \\xa0The staff who greeted us were nice and positive.I do have a few complaints about the gym, however. \\xa0The bouldering walls lacked safety ladders which I really wished they had. \\xa0This affected me a lot while climbing because if I was stuck midway on a problem or even if I sent a problem it was often difficult to navigate my way down. \\xa0And really, by the time you're up that high your strength has diminished immensely that it's very difficult to climb back down. \\xa0Often you just have to fall, and this could be a problem when you're at an awkward angle or just really high up. \\xa0I have ankle and knee problems, and while falling is part of the sport, it's always nice to take any safety precautions to prevent injury. \\xa0Also, there's a particular bouldering wall that goes pretty high up but the pads beneath it only extend about 4-5 feet from the wall. \\xa0You could definitely get injured in this area if you landed in the wrong spot, and having some kind of ladder would have made this wall much less terrifying.One other complaint I had was that the routes were a bit confusing. \\xa0To figure the grade of each route, there would be a handwritten key/chart designated for each wall, showing the grade/color of each route. \\xa0Sometimes it was confusing to figure out where the start of a route would be. \\xa0In the end, my friends and I just ended up ignoring the charts and just hopping on random problems. \\xa0But really, I loved this gym and I would recommend others to come and try it out. \\xa0The routes are challenging but fun, and it's perhaps the most affordable climbing gym I've been to.\"},\n",

I was on the wall the whole time, no waiting in line feeling like I've heard about in crowded gyms this small.Pretty much the entire top rope area was for beginners, and they could improve their safety by teaching people to belay properly even if they have ATCs tied to the ground.

       "  'text': 'So a week ago I got the Groupon deal - x2 one-month climbing memberships with free rentals and chalk, and 2 of their classes for each membership ($30 dollar value each - 4 classes total) for right around 45 bucks total. Sweet deal. My girlfriend and I met Trevor when we got there, who set us up with shoes, harnesses, chalk and taught us how to use the auto locking belay devices. He\\'s a rad guy who always seems cheerful and always happy to stop whatever gym-improvement related task he\\'s on to help out a member with anything. He even remembered me by name since day 1.If I had to give some sort of comparison/analogy for this place, I\\'d call it a \"mom n\\' pop\" climbing gym. Granted, I haven\\'t been to many of the other gyms in OC (just a couple), but this one felt different right away in comparison to the other gyms.I\\'ve seen all types of skill levels in here and I\\'ve yet to see the place get crowded to the point where it interferes with my climbing (let alone being crowded at all). If a certain wall is taken, there is always another wall with the same level route that\\'s open and even if you\\'re sharing a wall with someone, the crowd is friendly and everyone takes turns.A shower, bigger bathroom, etc. would be cool as someone else mentioned, but I\\'ve looked into leasing warehouse space myself and know that those are hard to come by - no big deal, there\\'s a 24 hour fitness across the street for showering before work.Ideas for improvement: Although I doubt anything would ever get stolen from this place, having the little cubbies for your stuff in view while climbing would be cool just to keep an eye on your phone, keys etc. Maybe move the cubbies onto the angled wall next to the wave?Anyway, I need to stop wasting time on Yelp and go climb. Awesome gym. definitely renewing my membership after the Groupon expires.'},\n",

As soon as we walked in they were very friendly and willing to help. They really gave the whole place a warm feel. They were always around to offer and hand or advise about a route/problem if needed and they seemed like they genuinely wanted to help you. I think this positive attitude must be contagious because all of the people climbing in the gym were extremely nice as well. Everyone seemed to be talking to each other and helping out other climbers.As far as the gym is concerned. I would say that it definitely has a different vibe to it than most gyms I have climbed at and I think that is mostly due to the owners attitude and hands on approach to running their gym. It had a very communal/small gym feel to it, even though the route diversity was great and well spread out. The routes were fun and challenging. There was also a good variety of climbing style within the bouldering area and the rope sections. The different climbing styles offer bouldering, sport climbing, and top rope. There is also a section towards the back of the gym and around (a somewhat hidden) corner that offers more of a beginner top roping area.The pricing for the gym is amazing also. $15 for a day pass and that included shoe rentals and harness rentals if you don't already have them. This is nice because most gyms charge additional (small) fees for the rental of shoes or harnesses. I was able to bring my friend who had just started climbing and since he didn't have any climbing equipment yet, he really appreciated that he got to save a little more than usual.Overall, I would definitely say that this gym was not quite as polished as some other gyms I've been to, but it covered all the basics and then some. Also, the community that it already seems to be establishing sets the bar above other local gyms. The owners approach to running their gym is amazing. I can only hope that this is something that is carried on permanently and not a short term means to make a good first impression.Try this place out! chances are you will end up loving it like I did.\"},\n",

I've been climbing for a little over a month and have only gone to rock climbing and have been going to rockreation and climbx in Costa Mesa and Huntington Beach. Aesthetic climbing has a great staff and were very welcoming on arrival. They're a pretty spacious facility with plenty of bouldering and top rope areas. They have an auto lock belay system and the ropes are anchored to the ground for top rope climbing. The setup is great for climbers who can climb and still be belayed by someone smaller. It's also great for beginners (we had a 1st time climber) who've never climbed or belayed.The price is also great, $15 day pass which includes gear if you don't already have. There was a kids bday party while we were there but otherwise it wasn't busy which was great so we could get some good climbs in.My only complaint and why i took off one star was that the walls for the top rope climbs isn't a rock facade but boarding, at least it's decorated but yea aesthetically I would've wanted a rock look like the bouldering walls. I also would've preferred color coded routes versus the taping but again just minor personal things.I would definitely go back as the staff is great and it's a good size facility and not as crowded as rockreation\"},\n",

       "  'text': \"Climbing is on the rise. Literally. My years at Solid Rock Gym saw little growth or expansion, but when the Lake Forest location closed Orange County was left with a void. Since then gyms have popped up all over Southern California and dare I say it climbing is going mainstream. It's modern, it's adaptive and the training ground for the TOP climbers. Well these guys sure had a dream to fill that void with really what climbing has needed in OC and beyond. I heard rumors of a San Clemente gym and now there is TruHold in Mission Viejo, Sharma's new gym coming, obviously Hangar 18, Mesa in SD, Vital bouldering walls in Carlsbad, but let's be honest if you don't go to Rockreation or Rock City the 2 most established gym's besides SRG when they left you were stuck driving way out of your way. Aesthetic and Truhold serve a much bigger population which is great for us as a community. The Arndt brothers (Dillon & Trevor) and Jeremy Meza have done a great job addressing a lot of the downfalls of previous gyms in the area and abroad. Not to sound like an elitist, but too often kids are exposed to climbing in more of a babysitting way, relying on excellent gym employees to wrangle them, keep their interest and whatnot. Having a staging area for comps, having event specific area's for kids to have their parties and a separate vertical top rope area keeps everybody safe and happy. The Yosemite and Joshua Tree room are decorated so well it's almost a shame kids will likely thrash it eventually. Members and nonmember alike fully enjoy the top out boulder, training room, and top ropes. Lead area requires the passing of testing certification. The training room lets people get on intervals where you can crank out and hours' worth of toproping or bouldering in half the time. Like I said earlier gyms are the training ground and with these new state of the art padding systems you don't have to worry about dirty rocks ever again. Makes us setters happy because it's less we have to clean. I really dig that there are bouldering specific gym's now and that new gym's like this still offer it all. Competitions are a lot of work, but a lot of reward. Something 25-50% of gym's choose not to do for a variety of reasons. ACG had a comp almost immediately, showcasing this brand new facility. These guys are on a facebook media blasting tear doing more for marketing than I've ever seen done for any climbing gum. Oh technology and the internet. Good setting and maintenance is key to keeping people happy and safe. Testing limits and ego's. You'll find challenge and reward regardless of your skill level here. You couldn't find more friendly, honest and humble owners \\xa0and with gorilla strong climbers to newbies training here every day welcoming all with open arms, you'll find your place here. As soon as \\xa0have my surgery's to fix a few old climbing injuries I'll be back here training again.\"},\n",

Now, I can access all Touchstone gyms (an awesome perk considering there are several in the Bay Area).What really stands out to me at Berkeley Ironworks is their friendly and helpful customer service. Not to mention, it has literally everything I need. The gym is equipped with cardio machines, dumbbells, squat racks, power racks, benches, a yoga studio, and a steam room.As far as the climbing, they are pretty well balanced with top rope climbing and bouldering. It is def a plus that you're not always going to see the same routes and holds. They switch them out from time to time.\"},\n",

       "  'text': \"As a powerlifter, I loved BIW. There were 5 squat areas (one power cage, 4 squat areas in the training rig), rogue plates, a ton of weightlifting bars (including a couple of rogue Ohio bars), microplates, a deadlift jack, weightlifting belts if you didn't have your own, and a lot of mat space for deadlifting. And best of all, most of the people using the weightlifting area understood gym etiquette so it wasn't often that someone was using the squat rack to deadlift (if space permits). On top of that, BIW was constantly adding/updating their lifting equipment. I was stoked when they added a glute ham raise machine and a reverse hyper. Unfortunately I no longer live in East Bay and am currently a 24 Hour Fitness super sport member, so I am writing this review to reminisce the days where I could select which weightlifting bar I want to use and have the option of using an ohio bar... Prices are steep compared to any other gym, but definitely worth it with all things considered. I never really used any of the climbing facilities, but would definitely recommend this place to any powerlifter looking for a second home!\"},\n",

       "  'text': \"It's been almost six years since I last reviewed Berkeley Ironworks, and even after all this time, I still consider it one of the best gyms in the entire Bay Area and definitely deserving of five stars. I like this place so much that I often travel all the way here from SF when I'm in town for work, even though I no longer live in the East Bay and there are many gyms closer to the hotel that I usually stay at. It might sound a bit odd that I would be so excited about a climbing gym when I rarely climb, but the fitness area at Ironworks is so amazing that you don't need to be a climber to visit or even become a member. I will say that the climbing and bouldering area here is HUGE, one of the biggest I've ever seen. However, I think that the real star here is the fitness area, which is also fantastic. I am a powerlifter, and Ironworks has some great equipment for both powerlifters and olympic lifters. There are plenty of squat racks, barbells, bumper plates, and other lifting accessories, in addition to lots of space to lift. There are also tons of different machines, including aerodyne bikes, concept 2 rowers, GHDs, cable machines, and a full array of standard gym machines. Additionally, there is a large stretching area with bands and other recovery items. All in all, this is one of the better gyms for serious lifters in the region. The locker rooms are great, with lots of lockers, showers, and clean stalls. The staff is super friendly. Prices are very reasonable, particularly day pass prices on weekdays before 3pm, but membership prices are great too. They have a good selection of workout drinks. The gym is located about a block from an Emery-Go-Round stop, which provides free transportation from BART. All in all, I would highly recommend this for anyone who is into their fitness, and while the name implies its mostly a climbing gym, you don't need to be into climbing at all to visit or become a member and get your money's worth.\"},\n",

In the long run, a monthly pass has great value when compared to a $25 day pass plus $4 shoe rental. There is a variety of boulder routes for both beginners and the experienced. The crowd is a mix of people, families with kids, students, and more. People were pretty friendly rooting each other on to conquer a route. Bouldering seems harder than top roping. There is no auto-belay for vertical climbing here, but there are classes teaching one to belay, so that is a plus. There is plenty of other weight equipment. Complete with lockers and showers, this can easily be someone's primary gym. Not an expert here, but here's a little warning to prepared to callous, bleed, and fall. My lifting callouses peeled, but I had a great time. I also had delayed soreness at the weirdest parts, my fingers and forearms especially. It's a great workout and involves not only strength, but technique, coordination and nimbleness. Lastly, don't worry about falling while bouldering-- the padding is some of the softest ever.\"},\n",

       "  'text': 'My partner and I have had a membership for about 17 months, and Berkeley Ironworks was initially one of my favorite places to spend a free evening or Sunday. The staff are friendly, there\\'s a lot of routes to climb, the yoga is great. I love the sauna. It\\'s also worth noting that my partner and I feel very welcomed as a queer couple here. This is one of the only businesses we interact with where people seem to know that we\\'re partners and not sisters. Thank you for that, BIW! All that being said, I\\'ve lately started to dread going to BIW and am considering cancelling my membership. It\\'s gotten so crowded that it\\'s hard to top rope or boulder without falling on top of people and doing a LOT of waiting for routes (I\\'ve noticed a significant change even in the short time I\\'ve been climbing here, and no it\\'s not a seasonal change, but rather a linear increase over time). Further, with more people seems to come an uptick in condescending attitudes. While people are waiting around for routes, there\\'s plenty or time for chit-chat about what\\'s going on around them. I HATE hearing strangers talk to each other about how I\\'m climbing a top rope route while I\\'m actively on it. Especially when it\\'s men doing the talking, which it usually is (\"she\\'ll really need to get over on the right wall up there\" or \"oh I climbed that one yesterday, it was a piece of cake, I just had to mantle on the crux and then pull up the weight of my cis-male ego using that right-hand crimp.\"). Which brings me to my final complaint. Where are the women and/or non-binary route setters? They used to have short setter bios on their website, and I don\\'t see the page there anymore. Maybe it\\'s changed since then, but last time I looked, the setters were almost all people I read to be men (except for maybe one person?). It shows in the climbs and their ratings. 5.9s and 5.10s can sometimes actually be pretty hard for me due to primarily drawing on arm strength, while the 5.11s and 5.12s, which are supposed to be harder than 5.10s, seem to pull more on flexibility and balance and less on pure brute arm strength. I feel so confused when a 5.11c is way easier for me than than a 5.10b, which I can\\'t even finish. I can\\'t trust the scale to help me pick routes that will be within my ability. Maybe this is just an issue for me. I\\'m willing to accept that possibility. Another possibility is that the system is based on what\\'s easier or harder, generally speaking, for men (who are doing the large bulk of the route-setting). Granted, this is a criticism that could apply to the climbing world at large and I don\\'t think the problem is specific to BIW. Still, they could do better. Due to these crowd and environment issues, the membership is starting to feel like it\\'s not worth the (increasing) cost.'},\n",

Maybe today counts as a holiday, but I have no way to verify it because it is not posted anywhere.Honestly, the overcharges wouldnt feel like such a slight if she was a little more kind.

I don't like that the bouldering and top rope areas are so close to each other (even overlapping) but perhaps that's just an issue of poor planning when building this place. There is much more square footage alloted to the workout equipment, which I have not seen at other Touchstone gyms.

       "  'text': \"I absolutely love this gym! I'm here 2-3 times a week and its always a blast hanging out with friends climbing or taking their many yoga classes. The crash pads are kept in great condition and provide the perfect support. The top roping routes are named after movies, novels, and various themes which is always quite entertaining. They have a nice steam sauna which is the perfect cool down after climbing. They also have ample gym equipment and lock rentals unlike dogpatch. My only complaint would be that it is on the smaller side and can get incredibly crowded during peak hours from 6-8 pm. I'd recommend coming in the early morning at 6-8 am or later in evening at 9-11 pm if you want to beat the traffic. They also don't change the bouldering routes as often as other gyms which is unfortunate because you are stuck doing the same problems if you come really often.\"},\n",

The cleanliness is more of an issue for an indoor gym that doesn't get direct sunlight or rain or other elements to kill the nasties carried around by grubby fingers that wipe away snot or are not washed properly after using the toilets. I'd love to see this improvement at all the Touchstone gyms. Overall, Touchstone offers a pretty good value -- I like being able to go to the different climbing gyms to get a variety of different routes, and it's fun to learn the style of the different route setters.\"},\n",

I also love to box and you can train in the yoga room when it's not in use...which is often. I get down on the speedbag super hard. They have heavy bags too if you're workin on your kicks and combos. Amazing set of workout equipment and enough for everyone to use.That being said, I have a gripe which will happily be edited out of this review if it's ever addressed. The amount of shirtless dudes in the afternoon is staggering. Shirtless smelly dudes is very disconcerting when I'm trying to focus on my climb.

       "  'text': \"First off, and foremost importantly: Ironworks is primarily a climbing gym and I'm not a climber. The other half of the gym is dedicated to cardio, lifting, and cross fit. To describe the essence of this place, would be to call it a dream for hippies that thrive on the bohemian vibe.I joined a long time ago, and was a frequent visitor. I took a super long hiatus before coming back this year. The major change since my earlier days, was the addition of much needed shower stalls and cross fit equipment/weights. I'm far from grungy, and I prefer not to have my goodie-bits displayed in it's full, regal glory to all, so this was a welcomed change. I'm also not a cross fitter either. But besides that, no major changes.Everything is a little rough around the edges. The free weights are plenty, but they're definitely in dire need replacing. The cardio-related machines are up to date, which is great, but the exercise machines all need a little TLC (new cushions/covers). They do have a ton of different machines, thankfully.Do you remember the smell of your high school gym? The smelly culmination of unused rooms, dust, equipment, and old wood? This place smells just like that, with the frequent linger of incredible body odor. Odor of immense suffering, unable to describe the individual components that seem to violate the very law of physics.Coming at the butt crack of dawn has the advantage of not having to wait for any machine and an available parking space in their lot.\"},\n",

I\\'m not a climber, so this review is for classes only. If you\\'re into climbing culture, Ironworks has all the rocks, mats, harnesses, and strongly-scented bodies to make you feel at home. I took a TRX class which was really intense (and fun!), but the room was quite small and tough to do all the movements without running into a neighbor or a wall (even though they limit capacity to 10 people per class). That said, sign up on the paper list outside the classroom door as soon as you arrive. Nobody at the front desk told me I needed to do this, so I the class filled up while I was standing around waiting for it to begin. Rookie mistake. Next I tried a spin class. If you\\'re used to fancy spin studios like RIDE or CorePower, Ironworks spin is a different animal. The bikes seem older, and less comfortable. The class is held in an attic-like room on the 2nd floor, with no A/C. The instructor I had was clearly very athletic, but not terribly engaging or energetic. It was a VERY long hour. Clearly, the classes here are meant to supplement the climbing aspect of the gym, which seems like the main selling point for members. I should have known I\\'m too into the \"boutique\" workout studios, with nicely polished floors and spa-like amenties to appreciate Ironworks\\' casual vibe. On the other hand, I\\'ve been nagging my husband to check the place out since he is all about the low-key gym scene. Different strokes!'},\n",

I never want for a kettle bell or free weights, and their lifting area offers enough space for me to do body weight and HIIT workouts. The cardio equipment and machines all seem to be kept in working order (which is more than I can say for some other gyms I frequent). Their bouldering wall could be a little taller, but the setting is always on point. They have a really healthy mix of difficulties, and even set enough simple routes for beginners like me. I've just picked up top rope this month, and have to take a belay test every time I climb. The staff is exceedingly patient with my inability to tie a figure eight knot. Everyone I've encountered is informative and has a solid customer service ethic. Arguably, the only drawback to this gym is having to contend with all the people who want to work out at the same as me. It gets pretty crowded.\"},\n",

       "  'text': \"I've been going to Ironworks for a few months now and I have to say it's great. I'd been going on and off to the Berkeley YMCA for a few years, and recently switched over with my wife.I'm not an expert in climbing facilities (I've only been to two others, and one is owned by the same parent company as Ironworks). That being said, I'm impressed with both the size of the facility, the number of bouldering and top-roping routes available, and the frequency with which the routes change. Haven't found myself wanting for more routes.The crowd sizes are manageable. My wife and I go on Mondays and Thursdays, and it's not uncommon for us to wait or re-arrange our workout or climbing routine because someone's taking a rack or a route that we want.The crowd's also a ton younger than the YMCA, I've noticed. Lots of young families, too. I've never had children in a space where I've worked out before. It's really cute to see the tiny kids climb with reckless abandon, but I'm afraid one of these days that I'm going to fall on a six-year old.The staff is super-friendly. The folks at the front-desk are way more friendly than my past few gyms, and the staff wandering the floor are polite (even when they're chewing you out for bad belaying technique).The cardio and weights cover all of the basics - I actually found the equipment comparable to the Y (fewer cardio machines, the same variety and availability of weights). There's no pool or basketball court.My only real gripe are Ironworks' weekend hours - the gym opens at 9, which is pretty late in my book. The gym opens much earlier on the weekday.Value is pretty good. I pay $65/month, whereas I was paying $60/month for the YMCA. I'm getting the same level of access to cardio and weights equipment, and all the climbing I want.\"},\n",

       "  'text': \"It's been over 2 years since my original review of BIW & it's time for a review update. So, what has changed between then & now that would prompt an update?With the gym itself, not much. The facilities are still pretty much the same now as 2 years ago.The thing that changed is my impression of BIW. I got some perspective. In addition to keeping this gym membership, I also added a 24 Hour Fitness membership this year.24 Hour Fitness gyms get crowded, really crowded. 1 particular 24 location gets so crowded that I stopped going because I would always spend significantly more time waiting for equipment than actually working out.That never happens at BIW. At least, I haven't encountered it. If I jog here from work & only have 10 minutes to lift weights before I have to jog back to work, I lift weights for that entire 10 minutes. No waiting for equipment.Even at gym prime time (evenings, after work), I usually don't wait for cardio or weight equipment. I get in, work out & get out. Yeah, BIW is a lot more $$$ than 24, but my time is worth it.Besides, I'm still getting a discount & 50% reimbursement from my work. That helps to close the gap. BIW is also the closest gym to my work, so there's still the convenience factor.BIW is a decent gym even if you don't climb at all. The biggest negative is that parking sucks sometimes. Aside from that, I'm a fan of working out more & waiting less. That makes me a fan of BIW.\"},\n",

Also of note, the men are also nice and pretty to look at, but that\\'s not my rope bag, if you catch my drift.Part of me wants to give Ironworks 4 stars, because the desk staff could at least pretend to be a little less disinterested in their customers, but the class instructors make up for that. They make up for it with a kind merry, ruthless, bubbly kind of sadism that says, \"I hope your getting more fit, but I really enjoy hurting you.\" Which, to be honest, is an attitude more instructors need these days. This hyper-supportive bullshit is turning us into the human equivalents of doilies, both physically and emotionally. I like instructors that kick your ass and laugh about it.Their yoga staff is more benign. The kind of people that exude a sense of well-being from every deodorant-crystal-covered-pore on their bodies. Their yoga classes range from the bendy stretchy slowy kind to the fast in your face breathe-stretch-ow-holdit-holdit kind. I don\\'t know what they call it. Vindiesel and Kowabunga or something.They also have spinning classes. But I\\'m not that much of a masochist, so fuck that.Besides the great classes. They have tons of walls are routes, with lots of topography. A solid bouldering section for people to check other out under the auspices of adventure sports, and great roped route for people actually there to climb ;)They have an impressive cardio area, a solid weight section, and even the floor space for Olympic lifts and machines. In the great words of that creepy guy from Robocop, \"I\\'d buy that for a dollar.\"Or more accurately, $70 a month. Which is awesome when consider that you get access to ALL of the gyms in their network, which includes a bouldering-only gym in the Dogpatch and Mission Cliffs.And here is something SUPER dope. If you get an Ironworks membership, you can take crossfit classes at their Great Western Power Company gym in Oakland. As many of you may not know, Crossfit is actually a very important physical fitness standard you will need to adhere to if you ever hope to survive life in Oakland. True story.Besides that, you can rent an IPad for free, they have locks at the desk in return for collateral, and they have a bloody sauna.This place is pretty much ideal. So just get a membership and stop screwing about...Actually when you get into climbing shape you\\'ll want to screw about a lot more so you have that to look forward to as well.Cheers.'},\n",

Lyn even offered us a free Intro to Climbing class, that we took her up on, and even afterwards followed up with me.This time around customer service was totally a different experience. A woman at the front desk helped us get set up and was really nice, welcoming, and quick to get us started. Ashley, our belay instructor was super chill and patient with us; she was very knowledgeable and answered all of our questions. The only reason for the four out of five stars is because some staff members are very unwelcoming and seem to hold an attitude:1st time at BIW - front desk person I spoke to there was terribly rude, not helpful, and blamed me instead of taking responsibility 2nd time at BIW - \\xa0staff member was getting annoyed with us because we were trying to find our correct shoe size, providing no helpOverall, we would come back and climb. I would just like to see some improvement in front desk customer service.*safety concern: there was a toddler hanging out in the workout area using the equipment while the parents were exercising as well (they were watching him but I personally don't feel comfortable with a toddler around the gym, especially weight training area)\"},\n",

I find myself drastically improving with roof cruxes after coming to BIW more often with friends who push me -- exciting!Parking is great here -- there is a private lot that is monitored by an Ironworks staff member as well as street (alley?) parking across from the entrance of the gym if the lot fills up. NB: One of the things I really like about the Touchstone gyms in general is that they double the rope at the top anchor, so there is additional friction that prevents the belayer from being lifted up from the floor.

Oh my gosh, I love sitting in the sauna after a good climb/workout. Yea, it gets crowded for sure, but it's never been debilitating for me. When climbing, it's usually a good idea to let your arms rest for a few minutes before getting on the wall again, so it's never been a major issue if I've had to wait between climbs. Also, because there is so much variety I feel like I can always find SOMETHING to do. If anything, I appreciate when it's busy because I get to chat with people, and I get to watch how other people climb, which ultimately helps me become a better climber. I also appreciate how frequently they update the climbing routes - not so often that I can't see my progress, but often enough to keep things interesting and challenging.If you're really concerned about how busy it gets, avoid coming on weekday nights, and instead try to go in in the early morning (before work or school) because it's empty. It's also way less busy on weekends.I've also seen people complain about the clientele being stinky. Yea, sure. But it's a gym, people get stinky, and there is nothing BIW can do to control it.

He was so nice especially when I had no idea what I was doing (boxing part), and he also yelled at me encouragingly to get me to finish those sit-ups and other exercises. This was a really good beginners class to get a taste of what boxing's about, but I can see if you want to attend this class regularly, it could get stagnant. My friends who had previously gone, said the routine was the same. Well it was my first time, and it kicked my ass. What a good workout! The rest of the gym looked cool, and the rock walls are high! I liked that it wasn't crowded (unlike Bridges in El Cerrito).\"},\n",

Yes and was not interested in the climbing aspect but thought I\\'d give the \"gym\" portion a try or so I thought...I signed up for 1 month a month ago and paid $100 for a 1 time workout and here\\'s why. When I sign up for a gym membership it\\'s usually only for the treadmills and the workout machines but both of these options at Ironworks totally suck.I tried the old outdated machines downstairs for weights and not only are they ridiculously rusty but they make a really loud clanging sound every time I lift. Also the way the lifting area is set up is unreasonable because those who want to climb the wall will need to pass you, therefore ending up in your personal space while your lifting... Come on hasn\\'t anyone noticed this?Downside number 2 are the totally dinosaur 70\\'s treadmill machines that I tried to use and none of them worked and when I was making my way to the most modern treadmill someone was using it, therefore ending up on a stupid skiing elliptical machine that doesn\\'t do squat for me.In a nutshell if you are looking for what I\\'m looking for in a gym then this place is not for you but by all means try it if your into this sort of thing. A heads up on cost: 1 membership at this climbing joint will set you back $71 a month if you pay for a year up front and the cheapest it ever gets if you pay up front is $65 a month, which is too high for me.So at this point I\\'ve joined PF gym, which is only 10 minutes away from my house for $10 a month and worth it for me.

The party \"room\" is located way in back and away from the main climbing walls, the weights area, and of course possibly a few self-absorbed 20-somethings who might have mentioned that they hate kids. We had a great time. Gayle was there as were 2 of her sons and her granddaughter. So was one of David\\'s old school friends and a few kids from the neighbourhood. The Berkeley Iron Works staff person who belayed the climbs was very good with the kids and the back climbing area fit their talents well. The pizza and cake also went over well and my son left the party very happy. The Berkeley Iron Works also has great potential for gym membership. Staff were friendly and helpful, there was a nice selection of cardio machines upstairs, the weight machines had good variety, the men\\'s locker room was well-appointed, and then of course there is the amazing collection of climbing wall options.

I\\'m not gonna haul my 60m to the gym every time just so I can have the privilege of using less than half of it.

Second, they don\\'t let you take the lead test unless you can climb 5.10b. Their reason for that is \"5.10b doesn\\'t have rests and we want to be able to see if you make the right choices even when fatigued.\" Seriously? There are 5.12 climbers that climb more dangerously than 5.7 climbers. What a ridiculous idea, why even have 5.8 and 5.9 lead routes if you\\'re gonna set a standard like that?

       "  'text': \"Breakdown of stars:Bouldering wall: 4Fitness Gym: 4Overall climbing options: 3Outdoor lead climbing training: 2Things I love about this rock climbing gym: - The staff are always friendly and helpful, even at 6am. - Good variety of climbs with some good long climbs.- Great bouldering with changes frequent enough to keep you interested but not so frequent that you can't finish a bouldering puzzle.- Other climbers are encouraging, respectful and helpful.- The locker room, sauna, and showers are consistently clean and relaxing.- Classes are offered for strength training, flexibility, and cardio.- Relaxation area where I've seen kids doing homework while their parents are climbing. - Enough gym equipment that I've never had to wait, or not wait long. - Membership in one is membership in all the sister gyms, which allows for some variety when or if you are in other parts of the Bay Area. - Reasonable climbing routes for kids both in the bouldering and top-rope climbing areas. Where this rock climbing gym falls short:- No lead climbing below a 5.10b. \\xa0Really?!? But there are so many climbs outdoors that are far below a 5.10. Other climbing gyms have indoor routes for 5.8s, for example, which allows lead climbers to practice clipping in, falling, managing the rope and having a second follow before heading outdoors.- Overhang obsession. A huge percentage of the rock climbing wall is continuous overhang. BIW seems to equate 5.10+ with overhang and they tend to have few interesting 5.10+ puzzles elsewhere in the gym. For years, I climbed at a gym near my work in the south bay rather than at BIW because of this. - Bouldering bottleneck. The bouldering area can get rather squishy, especially near the U-shaped area. - Outdoor etiquette lacking. Those of us who have climbed frequently outdoors would never dream of walking underneath someone's active rope because it is not considered to be safe, even when top-roping. But BIW is quite relaxed and does not teach or even suggest such etiquette. \\xa0- Class options can seem stale. When we joined BIW, they offered Pilates mat classes locally and Zumba at the downtown Oakland sister gym, Great Western Power Company. Within two months those classes were gone and they went back to very basic strength training. We were very, very disappointed.Overall, I'm happy with Berkeley Ironworks. Not thrilled, but generally satisfied.\"},\n",

I do love the variety they have in their pro shop, also. If I ever do switch back to more top roping, maybe I'll suck it up and pay their uber expensive membership fees. Not that it wouldn't be worth it -- it'd be great having unlimited access to TWO nearby gyms (Ironworks and GWPC), not to mention all their other gyms when I'm across the bridge or in the South bay (Mission Cliffs, soon to be Dogpatch Boulders, and The Studio!). Perfect way to keep my options open on those extra crowded days at Ironworks.For now though, I love climbing at Bridges in El Cerrito much more -- cushy reliable padding, bright open spaces, and less climber foot-smell. :)\"},\n",

I used to go to Bridges frpm 2011-2012, which honestly has much better bouldering (which makes sense, they're a bouldering gym). Most Tuesdays, they change a routes in a section of wall. They also have a good variety of fitness classes, and a slacklining set-up. Their membership rules can be really confusing, esp if you signed up under a special. I have advanced degrees in education and I swear I was confused on multiple occasions.  I switched membership because of a new job that made going to El Cerrito too much of a pain. In the end it was a good decision because:1) Multiple locations- I go to the Oakland and Berkeley one pretty regularly.2) Top roping options- it's not too hard to find a belay partner at the Berkeley location. I like knowing that if I fall off, I won't injure myself (it happens).I have still yet to try the fitness classes.On a side note. Love going to Berkeley Bowl late in the evening after working out.\"},\n",

It always felt dirty. And I always felt like creepy dudes were leering at me. I couldn\\'t go into the sauna at 24 hour\\'s Oakland location without worrying.This gym has gender separate saunas! And the clientele is less creepy dudes, more buff, cool, climber people! The gym equipment at Berkeley Ironworks is much better than at Great Western as is the climbing space. The staff is always really friendly, and I always feel comfortable trying new or difficult things here.Seriously the negative reviews I am seeing here sound crazy. I have not heard of anyone having those problems...the staff that I have seen more than once always remember my face (if not my name). The treadmills & cardio equipment are pretty good - some are older but they also have some new ones that have a cool screen on them that tracks your progress visually. The weight equipment is a bit on the older side, but still all usable...if your weights \"clang\" every time you use them...it means you\\'re not using enough muscle control to put them down gently...not that there is something wrong with the machines.The only thing I DON\\'T like about it is that sometimes on weeknights there are a lot of kids there, I think for some program. And they can be pretty annoying. But I\\'m willing to deal with it.As for the climbing, I am still a beginner and (protip) there are a lot of beginner routes alllll the way in the back on a slab wall behind everything else.'},\n",

We also bumped into our other friend J, which really shows how great this place is.Anyways, D and I decided to take a beginner's class, just so we dont forget anything or mess anything up. The class cost $30, which includes a day pass and renting shoes and a harness for the day. I think online it said that the class takes an hour, but it really depends on the size. Our class had 3 people, so it was relatively quick. I think about 25-40 minutes. Another class had about 10 people, and they took a lot longer.Basically the class teaches you how to tie as well as all the safety checks associated with rock climbing. And then the instructor watches you while you do your first top rope climb.There aren't many beginning level routes, and there seems to be more higher level stuff. A lot of people were lead climbing, and it was nice to lay down and watch. Btw, they have a bunch of stuff for bouldering. Which is fun too and doesn't require a class nor a harness.Now.. if only I could commit to becoming a member.\"},\n",

They have some really solid bouldering problems with a lot of variety of features, including a cave and a mini arch. I really wish you had the option of topping out though. Maybe I'm just spoiled because I climb at Bridges, but topping out makes problems a little more difficult and more satisfying to finish. Also, it would be nice if there were a more highball wall, just to make things more varied and interesting. The membership prices are also on the high side, which is what ultimately prevents me from becoming a member. It would also be cool if there were more discount nights for college students considering that this is the closest gym to Cal.I'd like to eventually do some toproping here and I'll probably update this once I get around to that.\"},\n",

I got in to climbing a little bit but not really hardcore, I really joined it for the gym portion. Which was a bad idea. The equipment is pretty ancient. And also the area where the gym equipment is, is not well maintained. It is often very dusty and I observed the people who clean the gym, and they don't pay attention to detail.For $65 a month, it was way too expensive to use just for the gym and I did not climb enough for it to be worth it for the climbing.

       "  'text': \"I've been a member of the Touchstone gym network for several years, as a member of Pipeworks when I lived in Sacramento, now frequenting both BIW and GWPC since moving to Oakland. \\xa0I have to say that for the money, one would be hard-pressed to find better access to both climbing and a full array of fitness equipment and classes. \\xa0Overall I am very satisfied as a Touchstone member.This review is specific to Berkeley Ironworks and does not necessarily reflect how I feel about Touchstone or their other gyms. \\xa0I'll try to be as objective as I can to make this a useful review and make it clear why I only give this gym 2 stars.Starting with the good:This is a pretty large facility with a multitude of routes for both lead and toproping and a lot of good bouldering routes as well. \\xa0I really enjoy all of the contours of their climbing structure with a few arches, nice arettes and plenty of overhang. \\xa0Unlike GWPC there are lots of top rope options for beginners here, which are pretty much grouped in 2-3 distinct areas so slower, less experienced climbers can take their time without congesting ropes accessing advanced routes.The fully stocked yoga and stretching room is nice to use when classes aren't accessing it, and makes a great space for the yoga and fitness classes. \\xa0There is a nice and fairly spacious free weight area with plenty of mirrors and usually an open bench or two. \\xa0There are quite a few (ageing) machines of all kinds so even during the very busy hours there is usually something open.Right next to Berkeley Bowl West, the location is fantastic for one that works in Emeryville, easily walkable or a short bike ride from anywhere in E'ville and accessed by Emery go Round.Now, unfortunately - the bad:This place is DIRTY and getting worse by the day! \\xa0It smells. \\xa0Don't even think about inhaling when tieing your shoes in the locker room, as getting your nose that close to the floor will make you puke. \\xa0Seriously it's that gross. \\xa0As others have said, most of the patrons stink (much more so than other Touchstone gyms) but that doesn't excuse the management from making an effort to clean the place every once in a while. \\xa0Even the hipsters and hippies appreciate a clean locker room and don't want to be forced to share in eachother's funk. \\xa0It is truly a funk buffet so say the least. \\xa0I used to enjoy using the sauna here....used to.To further expand on this, the sun's out guns out climbing steez is in full effect here, and apparently all the pasty scrawny white boys think chicks must dig their overdeveloped forearms and blinding pasty backfat...put on your shirt, bro. \\xa0Ever notice that it's only your belay partner noticing you and thinking you're cool? \\xa0The stench here is bad enough without you. \\xa0Also, they are apparently cool with bare feet in the workout areas, on the equipment, and on the machines..disgusting.The equipment here is ageing fast. \\xa0Some of the elliptical machines are epoxied to keep holding together, and all of the equipment is old, basic and janky. \\xa0Most of the rubber on the dumbbell handles is peeling off and all of the freeweights are constantly coming loose on the grip - very annoying.As I said, the yoga room is great, but is usually being used by a class, limiting you to a joke of a stretching area where there's usually 7 people jammed into a space that's really designed for 3 people. \\xa0It's dark, also smelly, constantly dirty, and has no mirrors. \\xa0In such a large building they could certainly figure something else out. \\xa0How much retail and couch space do they really need downstairs? \\xa0Another major downfall - the schedule of offered classes does not change here. \\xa0Ever. \\xa0Same as it was 2+ years ago. \\xa0Seriously? \\xa0Yeah. \\xa0Seriously.Finally, the children. \\xa0And please don't get me wrong on this one - it is absolutely fantastic that they have such a great kids after school program here. \\xa0I cannot emphasize that enough. \\xa0However, they need somebody that can handle them. \\xa0Without fail, with 400 lbs on the leg sled, there are 10 eight year olds working out on the finger boards, about 1.5 feet away. \\xa0Fine, I guess. \\xa0What is not cool with this is that you invariably have them playing under and hanging on the equipment on which you are trying to lower 6 times their body weight. \\xa0Not cool. \\xa0Meanwhile, their instructor is chatting up the parent that has snuck up to lean on the other side of your machine rather than trying to give you any kind of respectable (or safe!) distance. \\xa0WTF?!?! \\xa0The kids are fine, but please control them, and their parents!!There you have it - my justification for 2 stars. \\xa0The problem is that this place has so much potential. \\xa0They are raking in cash, as it is not cheap to be a member. \\xa0Maybe stop building new gyms and acquiring more property until you can handle keeping your existing facilities in the current century or at least clean. \\xa0Easily 4-5 star potential here if management made it look like they cared in the least. \\xa0Cha-ching....$$$$...bummer.\"},\n",

I can always find a recumbent bike open, which is all that matters to me.-Recently a friend and I decided to try to learn how to climb. Neither of us had done it before. I think most people who start climbing do it with someone who is an old pro or something because the two of us weren't catching on all that well or quickly. We took two intro classes and then were still embarrassed to find we couldn't remember all the safety checks. But then -- there was Ashley. One of the people who work at Ironworks: she was fiercely kind, nonjudgmental, and patient with us. She made all the difference in our feeling welcome (and not stupid, even though we maybe kind of were).-Also Ben. Ben was also wonderful and helpful when we had to exchange harnesses and shoes because we weren't sure about sizes etc.This gym isn't cheap but it isn't cheap for a reason. It's awesome and full of all sorts of options: it's a gym where you can actually rotate what kinds of exercise you want to do. Which - means you're more likely to keep exercising.

I admit I was upset and fired away more harshly than I should have, especially since this gym really is a great place.Overall, although it can be cold sometimes (doing some cardio negates this issue) and the weight area would benefit with more updates, I've had a very positive experience both climbing and lifting.

They had an amazing experience! All of them inquired eagerly as to how they could come climbing again in the future. We signed up for a generously discounted belay class, and the instructors were incredibly conscientious, patient, enthusiastic, and skilled. They \\xa0made the whole experience all the more enjoyable, especially because I knew my students were safe and supported as they tried something outside of their comfort zone. The gear check-out/check-in was easy, and the gym was so impressive and exciting for our students to see. It was great to see them challenging themselves in new ways, also. Students who previously have teased one another were cheering each other on to make it to the top. And they were so excited to be in charge of my life, as they belayed me! One student said, as I was going up the wall, \"you know I have a D in your English class, right?!\" It was so generous of the IronWorks staff to give up their time and energy for our students. It\\'s important for them to have these types of unique opportunities to stretch themselves outside the classroom in healthy and productive ways, and the shared experience has made a difference in my ability to get them excited about English.I would recommend that anyone who works with young people take them to IronWorks. Also, it\\'s a great gym if you\\'re into climbing and are sick of running or biking in circles at 24 hr fitness. The vibe here is just so positive and contagious!'},\n",

A few weeks later I found Ironworks, which has an amazing gym, tonnes of classes, and, of course, great bouldering and belay walls.Since joining, I've found out that many of my friends also use this gym, or one of the other Touchstone gyms (if you join one, you have access to all of them).

With this being said, this is my favorite gym in the bay area! The workers are always super nice and helpful. The equipment is nice and the facility itself is really cool. I honestly don't rock climb but I use the weights area. I train for powerlifting and the federation I compete in uses a specialized barbell called the Texas Deadlift Bar (for deadlifts, of course). The gym originally didn't have one but when my friend requested it they bought one!! They also have gotten more 45lb bumper plates because there wasn't enough for everyone if there were too many people deadlifting at once.

The rear windshield of our car was smashed out between 7:30 - 9am. Same thing happened to the car next to us and apparently it's happened to people who work there, too. Bottom line: If you're mostly interested in the gym for climbing and can get there by foot or bike, it's a great place.

Good problems overall though, and the steep wall near the entrance is pretty good to work on power and endurance as the ones with sit start end up being really long.

Its a very friendly & thorough class. Only reason I'm giving this place 4 stars, rather than 5 is because it is a little expensive for a day pass, or any pass at all.

The walls are awesome.I take a kid with me, and this is a great activity for us to do together. It really takes a leap of faith to climb a wall while relying on someone else to catch you. We have gone half a dozen times now over a one year period. I can only climb up about 3 or 4 times before my arms give out for the day, but this is as much fun as anything I've ever done.You guys rock!\"},\n",

       "  'text': \"This is only a review of the gym portion of Berkeley Ironworks; while I have climbed there, I really only use the gym. I mostly love BI, although a couple of things get to me. Pros:- On the love side, I am a huge fan of the fact that I can always get a workout, cardio or weights, without having to wait. There's a lot of equipment and machines (I'll get to those in a minute...). I hate waiting at the gym more than anything ever.- The staff seem pretty cool too, they've always been really nice and helpful. - I like the atmosphere/space and general attitude. Most people seem decent (you don't get a lot of meat heads here). The space is cool: as a huge wearhouse it is open and light without seeming too cold. Plus, you can watch people climb while working it out. Sort-of-cons: -The weights, equipment, cardio machines could use an upgrade. There are a lot of people who use them and most of the machines have seen better days. I have seen some maintenance going on but, really, I would love to see BI invest in some new cardio equipment.- This is sort of silly but I like to read when I cardio it and when I first came here, 2 years ago, there was a vast stock of magazines available for such purposes. Now you're lucky if you can find a 4 year old copy of Vegetarian Times to read. I am not sure if people take new magazines home or what ,but it would be awesome if they could get a good amount of decent subscriptions going. In the end, I really enjoy coming here and I get a great workout. I would love to see some upgrades in the gym section, but the lack of them will not keep me from coming in.\"},\n",

Some days I've had to wait for every route I've climbed, and it's only gotten worse with the Groupon they offered recently and the after-school clubs meeting there. Boo Groupon!-There's no climate control, so the rock can get quite cold in the winter and it gets hot upstairs in the summer.-Cost.

There is only one route setter I like - KY - please keep her! She rocks! As for the others I can do without. Uncreative and boring unless they are setting hard routes. Hey!

The downsides are it's Berkeley and I don't enjoy smelling Patchouli when I am gasping for air. Also I felt like I sweated more inside the gym than I would if I worked out (out side).

       "  'text': \"A list of why I like Berkeley Ironworks:1. Rock climbing is one of my favorite work-outs I've ever found. I'm never bored of it, I'm always challenged as much as I want to be. 2. The vibe of this place is great. Everyone is really mellow and usually easy going. 3. Even when it's crowded, you can usually find routes to climb in your level. Sometimes it's harder to boulder when it's crowded, but not bad. I usually just wait until later when it's calmed down a little bit. And if it's too crowded on the floor, you can go up stairs and do some cardio on the machines. 4. My climbing partner is my husband, and it's nice to actually spend time together while getting in a good workout. Two birds, one stone. 5. I like climbing clothes. Unlike a lot of other athletic endeavors, you can wear cute clothes while climbing and show off your REI fashionista style! ;) Okay, a silly reason, but I like clothes to be cute in any situation. 6. While I've only taken one yoga class there, I hear the classes there are great. I'm just not organized enough to show up at the gym at a specific time. My life is regimented enough, I can't apply it to my recreational time. To sum up: good gym, a lot of fun. I still haven't tried out the other gyms, but this one is great.\"},\n",

Since I\\'ve always loved climbing rocks and such, ever since I was a teeny tot, I figured I\\'d give it a go. Got there at 5:30 and the place was virtually empty; staff is VERY kind and sympathetic to newbies and there were lots of quiet, out of the way places to train, leaving the more advanced walls to the...uh...more advanced people. Staff IS on hand to train, but I was taught by the spectacular Heather S. Even so, the people who were climbing next to us, even though not on staff, were super helpful. Me and my, \"What\\'s a DELAY hook?\" (it\\'s belay stupid) weren\\'t any sort of problem to them and they were very patient about waiting for us to go up the wall first. So I give thumbs up to the other climbers here. There seemed to be no end of new walls to climb and more and more challenging things to try (as a newbie, I ignored the colored tape, cut me some slack yo) especially the bouldering on the back wall. Added plus, the gym and the overall lack of BO/sweaty haze that often comes with working out in a gym. Just good clean, good-lookin\\' people, climbing up walls. FUN! (Plus bottled water is only a $, how\\'s that for recession proof?)And I saw one of my favorite people in the whole universe, Ms. Maya G. there (she ambushed me from behind).

One thing that got me was the price however...as a first timer you will spend at least 30 bucks because you have to take a class...which of course is completely necessary and very helpful! The staff there are all very cool! They will make sure you graduate their class wit honors, too. Overall, it was a fun way to get some fitness in for the day, and if your afraid of heights, this is a fun way to really get over it and challenge yourself. I almost gave up plenty of times, half-way up the high rocks...but then I thought about the money I spent and realized i better get every penny worth!They also have a nice gym, fun fitness classes to take and a small sitting section for lazy onlookers. Pretty cool!'},\n",

They offer lessons, group and private and as far as price goes it\\'s about on par with any other gym. What I like the most about it is the comfortable environment they provide for you to learn in. At first I felt completely ridiculous attempting to climb a wall, getting freaked out about the height and yelling \"ok ok take me down!!\" all the while an 8 year old is next to me scaling the thing like there\\'s candy at the top. Little punk. Yet after a little while I found myself being encouraged by surrounding climbers, letting me know which walls are easier to start on and which aren\\'t. Everyone was very friendly and I can\\'t express it enough how much that helps. Only downside I\\'ve seen so far, it gets busy!

I thank this place for preventing me from becoming obese from my insatiable appetite.I'm a boulderer and this gym has so many problems to do. Plus, they frequently add new problems over time!! Way more frequently than the Oakland gym. I'm up to V2 and going on V3 level, but this gym caters to all levels. There's so many V0s to try out for the beginner and a lot of V5+ for those crazy rockclimbers.i'm not a big gym rat that i use exercise equipment very much, but there's a lot to choose from - treadmills, steppy-things, pushie-pullie contraptions, weights and such.I'm more of a fan of the classes that they teach there. I used to do some yoga, and it's really challenging. The instructors there always ask around what people want to focus on and really caters to each class with a custom set of positions. There are classes everyday, i just wish there were more choice later in the day for us workers/commuters.Otherwise, they have activities for those who just kinda want to hang out: foosball, magazine/couch area, and (one of my favorite perks) a sauna.This place is very chill, very fun, and not one of you regular boring gyms.5 stars!!!\"},\n",

I\\'m here almost everyday either working out or climbing. \\xa0 The things I love most about Ironworks (as opposed to the other Touchstone gyms I\\'ve been to) are the awesome, friendly, and helpful staff members; the huge cardio and weight area (as well as the view of the rock walls from the cardio and weight machines); and of course, the rad climbing. \\xa0 This Touchstone gym is larger, or at least the layout is such that it feels larger, than Great Western Power Co and Mission Cliffs. \\xa0Diablo Rock Gym is kind of far out if you\\'re in SF or East Bay, but is comparable in size. \\xa0Haven\\'t been to Pipeworks and MetalMark is still in the making.Other great perks not to be missed: \\xa0classes to help you improve your climbing - usually for a decent price; a huge range of fitness classes (definitely go to Wendy\\'s spinning class on Friday am - it\\'s an ass kicker); clean bathrooms and showers with shampoo, conditioner and bodywash; great social environment complete with competitions to test out your climbing skills; and lots of free parking.My only complaints: \\xa0(1) I wish they changed the routes a little more frequently, but that\\'s only because I climb about 3-4 times a week; (2) I wish they had more than one \"good\" (ie newest Precor) elliptical; (3) Sometimes they take a while to get broken cardio machines back up and running.Contrary to what some reviewers say, this place does not smell and is impeccably clean. \\xa0If you smell anything, it\\'s because someone\\'s been climbing in their shoes for a looooong time :). And hey, what\\'s wrong with that?? \\xa0Chalk dust is to be expected...it is a climbing gym after all.Go sign up!! What are you waiting for?'},\n",

When I first got involved with Ironworks in the fall of 2005 I was impressed by the large scale size, impressive walls and vast climbing routes & problems. Some cons of Berkeley Ironworks and the Touchstone Gyms is it's pricey. $65.00 an month! In addition to a $100.00 initiation fee, ouch. It's definitely not cheap. In regards to being good for kids, it varies. Some days and times are good to have children there, but other times when it's crowded, not so much. The stress of safety is so paramount there, that one little distraction from a kid can mean a belayer potentially doing a dangerous thing to his climbing partner. Touchstone gyms have a handful of incidents that led to painful accidents, so keep an eye out for the safety signs everywhere in bold text and in plain view.All in all if you want a gym experience that offers weight machines, climbing, and specialized classes. It's worth checking out. If you can dish out the money per month without breaking your bank account. Go for it!\"},\n",

The best part is, this gym is FUN.I started top rope climbing almost three months ago with a partner, and after twice weekly sessions, we\\'re both now comfortably climbing 5.8\\'s and 5.9\\'s and even tackling some 5.10\\'s, and yesterday I got my first V2 on the bouldering wall. The staff is extra nice-- Dan gets his own five stars for being so awesome-- and the regular climbers are easy to chat up if you ever have any questions about technique or bouldering problems. The top rope routes and bouldering problems change just often enough to stay challenged but not so often that you couldn\\'t work on a tough project before solving it--sometimes it takes a few tries. I can easily spend 3-4 hours here just climbing and watching people. BIG points for being able to just toss my stuff in the \"lounge\" area without ever having to worry about it getting stolen. I also have to appreciate the insane amount of good-looking climber dudes who practice here (partner and I nickname our favorites-- \"Mountain Man,\" and \"Hot Spanish Guy,\" among others). I\\'m telling you, in just ten weeks this place has pratically become my second home. I heart Berkeley Ironworks!'},\n",

Every problem is a sloper problem and was kind of annoying. Also, this gym SMELLS. Halfway through our session, it started to smell absolutely terrible around the bouldering area. Besides that, the gym is clean and big. Lots and lots of crash pads to share and a nice big bouldering section.

       "  'text': 'I got talked into trying the yoga class recently, my first attempt at said activity. I\\'ll admit that I largely accepted the stereotypes and expected to be about the only man in a roomful of women... not that that\\'s an all bad thing! However, it was very cool to discover that the class (a Thursday evening \"Yoga Tune-Up\" class) was evenly split between men and women. The instructor, Sadie, was friendly and welcoming, and none of the activities were beyond my ability, though the cumulative effect was notably challenging. Given my concerns, I was impressed by her attention to proper technique and injury prevention, and the fact that I heard a lot more about \"stretching your latissimus dorsi\" than I did about \"finding your center\". Sadie also made a point of relating many of the moves and muscles to climbing skills. As a beginner and a math/science guy by background, those descriptions really helped build comfort and credibility. The range of equipment available was also impressive.This was also the first time I showered here rather than at home, which gave me a new perspective on the locker room. The textured stone floor gave excellent traction even wet from the showers, which are communal (no stalls), much like in high school. There\\'s also a sauna available, though I unfortunately didn\\'t have time to use it.Overall, my experience with the class and the locker room pushes my opinion of Ironworks up into 5-star territory. Of course, it didn\\'t hurt any that I managed to be sufficiently Gumby-like that Sadie speculated that I was a master yogi in a past life! [Cue pick-a-nick basket jokes]'},\n",

       "  'text': 'Berkeley Ironworks is part \"jungle-gym\", part regular workout place and part evening community meeting place. My experience here has been positive, as is evidenced by the fact that I have been climbing here once or twice a week for almost two years now. I find it affordable. I tend to buy the ten-passes but have also had the membership when it was cost-effective for how often I was going. I also find it laid back and just the right balance of clean enough but not sterile-looking or upscale. It draws the kind of people I like to play (read: climb) around and I have met some of my favorite people in the area here.BIW executes their business largely with grace. But, it IS a business with different kinds of people as customers and staff - and rules to follow. But, you want total DIY freedom, go outside! While I do often roll my eyes when I see staff repeatedly walking past eagle-eyeing my rope management, deep down I obviously appreciate knowing that they are watching so that sloppy or distracted folks (could be me, too, but I don\\'t think it is) won\\'t fall \\xa0- on me, near me, at all, yuck. I overheard a beginner class once while climbing nearby, and enjoyed it. The teacher was clear and engaging and made me think about my belay operation in a way I liked. I see a lot of beginners and parents with kids climbing here, which is great.The place is hopping in the evening after work hours, and is tranquil and sparse during the day. I like to watch the elite climbers ballet dancing up the wall in the lead-climbing cave, the ladies in full makeup who sweat it out on the stairmaster like champs, the beginner climbers in rental equipment being coached by friends on how to actually come back down after they get to the top, and young and old bad-sses alike playing acrobat in the bouldering cave. Sure I have met some people who were self-absorbed or oblivious to the line as they did laps on a route, but this has been rare, I can honestly say.I like the big warehouse windows and sliding bar doors that slide open to air out the place on warm days, and the continuously circulating artwork by local artists. I like the new women\\'s showers and the quiet wood sauna in the locker room where I like to bake after getting worked over by the overhangs. The non-climbing wall workout facilities are cozy but effective and comprehensive, though I don\\'t use them much. I like the lofted area especially, and that you can watch climbers from most places in the gym, which is more entertaining than reading a magazine, to me.'},\n",

I joined with an acute optimism, a feeling that someday I would try to climb... but in the meantime I'd just read US Weekly on the elliptical machine. Then I tried climbing. The first few times were humbling to humiliating and fully exhausting but now only 3 months later I'm up to intermediate climbs. It's really amazing how different I feel- stronger, calmer. I can't recommend this place enough. I remember reading a lot of reviews about macho guys but I guess I go during the day- I see mostly mid 30's women in pairs climbing like spiders. Don't be intimidated by the belay test and all of the things you have to know- it's pretty easy and everyone has to go through it at some point. Also: intesne indoor cycling, so-so yoga classes, fantastic core/abs classes and saunas! Nice.\"},\n",

I don't mind going to gyms, but the bf hates them... He LOVES this place, though. I can mess around on the exercise equipment and with the weights, and he can go bouldering, since normal workouts are too boring for him. And we both love the rock climbing. He weighs 60+ more pounds than I do, but I am still able to keep him up! So if I can do it, anyone can. Also, I have practically NO upper body strength, and this workout is still totally doable. I'm actually getting stronger! They have saunas (one for each sex) which I have not yet tried. They have ample clean towels and lots of (busy) staff. There are hand-sanitizing wipes around the gym, and they provide tape to wrap up fingers so as not to get, or aggravate, blisters while climbing. I pay around $120 a month for the both of us. \\xa0If I wasn't so cheap, this place would get 5 stars from me.\"},\n",

I usually come there and climb with my girlfriend a couple of times a month, but I for some reason would rather pay for a day pass rather than signing up.First, I used to climb in Boston several times a week and could just make it up a 5.10. Here even when I haven't climbed for 1 month, I warm up with a 5.10B. The top-ropping ratings are way too easy. This is a shame. Why not just downgrade them? I feel like I'm cheating when I'm climbing at this gym. I try tell myself that a 5.10B here is a 5.9 on the east coast.Second, the male staff has generally been very arrogant and rude. When coming there, I often feel like a 10 year old kid being scolded.Third, there way too many testosterone filled guys who need to show off. I'm comparing to my experiences in Boston, and at this gym I feel like the guys have an urge to show off try to be better(which is quite funny, when it doesn't work). On the good side though, I've done kettlebell training for 5 years now and they have a very good selection of kettlebells and good space to train with them. Also, a lot of the routes are fun, but the rating is way off.\"},\n",

I will have to agree with the other reviews about how this place can get very crowded. At one point, we just climbed whatever route with a free rope because we didn't want to wait. I may consider getting a membership eventually, but for now i'll stick with just getting day passes. 4 stars for excellent routes, but minus one for the crowds. The plus about getting a membership though is that you can use it at any other touchstone gym (i.e. GWPC in Oakland or Diablo Rock Gym in Concord). I think GWPC has less for the beginners, but the crowds are definitely not too much of a problem there.\"},\n",

       "  'text': \"First, I love this place. I spend more time here than any single location besides my home. Sure the mats under the climbing areas are chalky and not all of the staff are outgoing, but it's a great community and the facilities and classes are amazing. It's the most fun you can have working up a sweat in a public building. Second, that European guy in spandex is French. The spandex is a holdover from the 80s when regular men's jeans were super tight and shorts were really short - and climbers didn't have their own clothing companies - so they borrowed stretchy tights from cyclists. Nowadays most climbing guys wear loose pants or long shorts with gussetted crotches or some stretch in the fabric \\xa0so they can move. But I bet most climbers over 40 have some embarrassing photos of their neon pink and green butts from that era. Third, just about anyone who is willing to work at it can be a great climber - you don't have to have a certain body type or excellent fitness when you start out. I can't honestly say I've ever seen an obese climber, probably because it's hard to develop enough grip strength to support that much body weight for long. But I HAVE seen excellent climbers who are somewhat overweight, who are over 60, who are very short, etc. But don't be afraid if you can't do pull-ups! Climbing is more about skill and technique than strength, especially when you're just starting out. I did eventually get strong enough to do pull-ups from climbing, but I was climbing overhangs when I was a weak slip of a girl. If you just keep trying patiently, the wall and your fellow climbers will teach you what you need to know, and you will get stronger. Big lesson number one - get your feet higher and use your legs to push you up. Fourth, climbers at Ironworks are really supportive and any competition is friendly. \\xa0No matter what level you climb at, people will be cheering you on. Fifth, if you keep coming to Ironworks, you will become one of those super hot fit people. As for the crowds, the parent company (Touchstone) just opened a new climbing gym about 3 miles away in Oakland called Great Western Power Company - just drive down San Pablo and take a left on 20th, look for the big smokestack. If Ironworks is too crowded, you can always go there. It's smaller but still an excellent facility and not as packed.\"},\n",

The Westlake gym is small and the bouldering walls are shorter than every other single place I've been to but I don't think there's much they can do given the size of the place and the top rope section. The bouldering section has pads you can drag around for extra fall protection but the ground is semi-squishy and the walls aren't tall enough to do any major damage. The owner (?) with the long hair is sometimes very blunt and can come off as rude but it's nothing too bad. During the weekend afternoons and weekday evenings it is super crowded which is only made worse with the lack of space they have. Weekends are filled with little kids running around and screaming. Also, even though it's a gym, there is no water fountain. Overall, an okay place that you just have to deal with until someone comes and opens a better climbing gym.\"},\n",

       "  'text': \"If I wrote this review yesterday, I would have given Boulderdash 5 stars. Unfortunately, sometimes it takes a negative experience to make someone actually come on Yelp and write a review. My daughter first climbed at Boulderdash in Westlake when she was in first grade, which was six years ago. She took a class through park and rec and loved it. Her instructors were great; it was a positive experience. Six months ago, my daughter started climbing again, after six years off. She started with a couple classes a week. Three months ago, she became a member. With her membership, she gets unlimited access to the gym and yoga classes. There was an initiation fee, but it felt reasonable to me. The terms of the membership were explained to me well. Her membership included a belay class, which they allowed me to take since she was not quite old enough to belay. Alex, the instructor of the classes she was taking told me about a teen climbing group and invited my daughter to join. She began going to teen climbing a few days a week. She has loved it. She could climb/belay (she took the class after her birthday so she could join the group) for two hours any week day. Alex is so great and really helped my daughter learn her new sport. Sometimes she was the only one to attend and sometimes there were several other kids. Regardless, he spent the time with her, guiding her in the sport. Suddenly today, Alex alerted us that the teen climbing group has been discontinued AND that he is no longer going to be at the gym. I believe canceling the class is a big mistake for the Boulderdash management. This class was a wonderful outlet for my daughter and several other young people. I am so disappointed and so is my daughter. I have not decided exactly what to do yet, but unfortunately, there isn't much option to go anywhere else. There's nothing else in town. I sincerely hope this is not a permanent change. These young climbers and their friends are Boulderdash's potential long-term clientele.\"},\n",

When we asked him to be nicer in the future, he was defensive and irritable, and he had to yell and keep arguing with my wife about the time instead of just apologizing. He acted like he owned the place and he didn't care about any of the customers' feeling. 630 is not an easy time for everyone to make especially if you have kids and need to commute to work and back. Lighten up Matt! For the owners, Matt is not very good for your business If you want to bring in and keep more customers. On the plus side, though, Marshall is awesome and a great instructor. He kept it fun while still emphasizing how important it is to be safe.\"},\n",

       "  'text': 'Great place for rock climbing if you live in the Thousand Oaks area. However. The employee Matt (long curly grey hair, older, skinny, grumpy looking guy) has terrible attitude to customers! We were late for a few minutes for a rock climbing class where there were just me, my husband, one other guy, and the coach. As soon as we got in, we felt really bad and apologized, but he started yelling at us saying \"you guys were really late. Don\\'t do this!\" He wasn\\'t even looking at us when he was yelling. Later on, at the end of the class, I tried to talk to him and said I didn\\'t really appreciate his attitude and the way he treated his customers didn\\'t feel right. I asked him if he could please be nicer next time, especially we apologized for being late at the beginning.\" Without feeling bad at all, he still wouldn\\'t make eye contact with us, and then started being extremely defensive. He said \"I didn\\'t give you an attitude. Why are you asking me to be nicer? Was I not clear when I explained myself?\" I think Matt\\'s attitude will continue to cause problems. Either they didn\\'t train him right, or he has some problems himself. Marshall, our trainer was great, though. I highly recommend him and we enjoyed his class!'},\n",

       "  'text': 'I love this place and need to scream it from the rooftops.Staff is very knowledgable, friendly, and as helpful as can be. As in most of life, when you treat someone with respect and offer understanding, you will generally receive the same in return. A few things to consider based on my experiences:#1, Safety is their number one concern. Lives are on the line.You will be belay tested, both for top-roping, and for sport climbing. If you mess up, you will fail the test -- there is no leniency and rightfully so. It\\'s not a game. It\\'s a sport. And a very dangerous sport. The good news is, the belay test is free. The other good news is that if you do it right, your climbing experience can be very safe.If you\\'re leading, you will likely be watched like a hawk and called out for bad clipping (skipped, z) or general dangerous behavior (foot behind the rope, etc.) Lazy belaying is not allowed -- read as: sitting down, or anything other than standing and paying attention. You need to be able to tie a figure-8 knot if you\\'re over a certain age; 13, maybe? I\\'m not sure what age it is. I\\'m significantly over that age, so I had to learn.#2, This is a business. They\\'re here to make money.I was reading a couple of reviews down below that sparked me to post this. Someone was complaining about being late to a scheduled class and having an issue with one of the staff. Hmmm. What about the other people in the class? Are they supposed to sit around and wait for you? What about the instructor? Is he supposed to stay longer to accommodate you because you were late? Do you expect the owners to pay the staff to stay longer to accommodate you? If they let you into the class, are you going to complain that you didn\\'t get the full class because YOU WERE LATE TO A SCHEDULED CLASS?All I can say is that in most of life, if you\\'re going to be late, call and explain the situation; perhaps they can find another way to help. Just spitballing here, but if 6:30 was going to be so tough (and it sounds like you knew you were going to be late based on your comments, \\xa0\"630 is not an easy time for everyone to make especially if you have kids and need to commute to work and back,\") perhaps you could hire one of the employees to teach you at a time when you could be there? I don\\'t really know, and neither do you, because you didn\\'t call before your scheduled appointed time.Small life-based rant: I\\'m sorry if you don\\'t understand that other people\\'s time is valuable, but you probably should learn that. A tough lesson for many to realize is that the world does not stop when you mess up. Question --- If you\\'re in the #2 lane and about to miss your freeway exit with a busy freeway around you, do you A), bully your way across the freeway so you can make the exit, or B), accept that you messed up, and get off at the next exit? I\\'d wager you both are A). For me, personally, Matt has gone out of his way to help with anything that has been wrong or weird pertaining to my Boulderdash experience. Of course, I always offer respect and understanding, as with all employees, and people, really, and get the same in return. #3, It\\'s nice that they change the routes frequently. #4, EVERYONE is friendly. If you go by yourself, you can almost always find someone there who will trade belays. \\xa0#5, While they do not have showers, there is a locker room (with locking door) where you can change.#6, SO BRIGHT! They updated the overhead lights in that place and added some in the boulder area. My hats off to the entire BD team.'},\n",

       "  'text': 'Was visiting some friends out and on a whim decided to check out Boulderdash. It\\'s a hidden climbing gym in TO! Even with the GPS on it was fun to find, from the road we were on we only saw signage for \"Spirtual Center\" but we had our hunch from how tall the building was from the outside. Make sure you go to Suite A, at first we found Suite B. Which is okay because walking across the courtyard we got to see the huge fountain. I\\'m diverging a bit here but if you must check it out, it\\'s the size of a large swimming pool with a swan in it! Not going to lie, was slightly disappointed when I first saw the bouldering area. \\xa0The bouldering area is condensed and doesn\\'t go up very high. This is good if you\\'re afraid of heights or falling, in a way it encourages climbers to do their top rope sections. The entire floors is spongy, but there are a couple crash pads to drag around to further cushion any falls. The routes were mixed, with many challenging routes though since all the walls have an incline to them. The way the routes are set up stresses the importance of technique and planning moves ahead of time. Since I only bouldered I can\\'t comment on top rope routes. A kid\\'s birthday party was having a blast on the routes though, their exuberance and natural skill really made me old. The instructors seemed really great, they had the kids stretching, doing push-ups and some core work outs before climbing. \\xa0Really nice facility over all:Locker room to store your stuff so ins\\'t all over the placeClean restroomsSells drinks to rehydrateLarge windows to provide natural lightingFree weights and medicine ball Gymnast ringsClimbing rope They are opening up a second Boulderdash soon in Chatsworth, so next time I\\'m on this side of the valley hopefully I can check it out. Fun thing: Their slackline was hidden on the other side of the check-in counter... like two stories up in the air! Now that\\'s exciting.'},\n",

When I was ready to buy the 10 punch pass, I realized I forgot my debit card at home, but if I drove home, I wouldn't have time to climb. Paul gave me the student discount(I graduated from the school of Hard Rocks). Plus he pitched in out of his own pocket.I put on my new shoes. But they were two left feet. I switched the shoes in different boxes when trying them on. Paul helped me out again.They have a vast amount of open space and high ceilings, and it was nice and cold. It was clean, had a nice lounge area, and everyone seemed friendly. The music they played was also good, I love Insane Clown Posse(woop woop!). Overall, it was a great Friday night.\"},\n",

We had 25 of her preschool friends (climb) and their parents (watch). \\xa0We had many kids and parents tell us this was the best party ever. \\xa0Staff were extremely organized, welcoming, and encouraging with the kids. \\xa0Most kids were a little hesitant at first, but that didn't last long as climbing is very natural for them (seeing their friends do it helps). Parents were definitely wowed to see their kids climb the different routes and many said they can't wait to come back. \\xa0Christian and Alex are great with kids - this really set the tone for the event. \\xa0Many thanks to them. \\xa0We had a few guest arrive very late toward the end of the climbing session. \\xa0I was worried that they would miss out on the climbing and was expecting some tears. \\xa0But I was impressed to see that Staff made a point to quickly harnessed up the stragglers and get them on the wall right away. My wife has super high standards for these things (if you know what I mean) and the guys a Boulderdash delivered big time. \\xa0Huge thanks to them - WOW.Tips: we had our party sat morning when it was mostly empty. The party room isn't huge but comfortably seated 25 kids at a table with parents standing behind them with room for a couple tables for food/drinks/cake. We put our drinks in their fridge the night before. They are well prepared to handle bday parties. We used D'amores pizza (delivery) and Spinkles cupcakes (pickup) - we are happy with both and they are very close to Boulderdash.\"},\n",

       "  'text': 'First time checking out rock climbing thanks to my job for compensating the intro Up Rope class and me finally giving it a try :)I enrolled in the Thursday night class and there were only 3 of us students. Marshall was an awesome rock climbing instructor making it easy to understand the basic rules and techniques of belaying and climbing. We started in a empty classroom and then applied our knowledge on the climbing walls. Everyone is really easygoing and encouraging. Only good vibes here. I was nervous at first but had a lot of fun climbing. It was challenging because of the colored rock routes that you want to follow are kinda crazy and you don\\'t want to look down while going up lol. The belaying part is actually a workout too because of the constant slack in the rope that you want to remove while the climber is climbing. I would definitely recommend coming here for an intro class or free climb time. I befriended my classmates and might consider getting a punch card membership (just because I don\\'t think I can commit to a monthly membership and TO is a bit of a drive from Oxnard lol). P.S. I love the names of their rock climbing routes. I remember I climbed on the route called \"Mushroom\" and there\\'s another route I saw called \"2 Chainz\" LOL.'},\n",

I breezed through some of them through swinging and smearing and realizing that all the technique in the world couldn't help me complete most of them because I simply didn't have the wingspan or body length that would allow me to go from one handhold to the other. \\xa0To the setters: Gigantic handholds do not automatically equate to a V0. \\xa0Whoever set the bouldering problems didn't think through how to set up the problems for people of different heights and clearly didn't know how to have a variety of problems to practice different techniques. \\xa0There is more to bouldering than swinging and smearing your way to the top.I'm going to need a solid week to undo all the lack of technique I used to complete the bouldering problems due to lack of planning on the parts of the setter(s) at Boulderdash. \\xa0This is the only rockclimbing gym in the area, but I'm disappointed that they're acting like it and resting on their laurels.At least the day pass is only $15...\"},\n",

When they heard about Boulderdash, they were eager for me to take them so I did. It cost $38 only to find out that they would only be able to use the small climbing area unless I was willing to fork over some additional money to get them private lessons so they could climb on the bigger walls with ropes. Shame on me for not understanding that Boulderdash catered to serious climbers but the kids left after 20 minutes with a look of disappointment on their faces. To make matters worse, as they were retrieving their shoes and returning their rented climbing shoes, the older gentleman who performed that service remarked that they had climbed in \"clown shoes\" that were too big for them. If that was the case, why did the young woman who gave them those shoes not point out to them that climbing shoes should be a smaller size than their regular shoe size? Maybe there should be a warning label on their website that says \"For serious climbers only\".'},\n",

One downer is, contrary to the misleading name, the gym does not offer too may bouldering routes - in fact, its mostly top roping. However, this is still a pretty cool gym. I became a member after climbing here a couple of times mostly since it made sense to me. They change their bouldering problems quite frequently - so that certainly helps. Looking at the problems, it appears that the gym does have good setters. For me, this is the perfect spot to get a quick climb before jumping on the freeway to Pasadena :) The crowd is professional and respectful, which is important when the bouldering space is small.

There was a birthday party but the kids seemed to be well-behaved and not running under climbers. It's nice to have a variety of shorter and taller top rope walls. The belay test was easy- the staff will have you tie in as a climber, climb up a short wall, take a fall and then belay using an ATC and prove you never take your brake hand off the rope. I think it's ridiculous grigris are not allowed in the gym whatsoever. It seems more dangerous to have the lead ropes on the wall next to the lead climbing area for anyone to use rather than checking them out at the front desk.This gym seems great for children's birthday parties or drop-ins. I would not recommend a membership as there are not too many routes or problems. The bouldering section is very short with approximately 11 ft walls and about 6 inches of padding. Setting seems fine but does not appear to happen often as some routes were dated in May.\"},\n",

I have been climbing at Boulderdash for over two years now and having been to many climbing gyms in different states, and I have to say this is the best one I have ever seen. The routes are long, challenging and flow really well. You can lead all of the tall routes (45 ft), and there is an awesome overhanging area that is only lead climbing. There is a shorter wall with more bouldery routes that is top-rope only, and there is a fairly large bouldering area. The bouldering has to be my least favorite part about this gym because there are no top outs and some of the routes are really contrived and awkward but I guess that is bouldering for you. All in all this gym gets 5 stars: the routes are awesome, the staff is super friendly and helpful, the owners know what they are doing and talking about, and the membership is affordable ($60/month). I would highly recommend this gym to anyone even if you are just learning how to climb or are a seasoned climber who needs to stay in shape.'},\n",

       "  'text': 'Where would I be without Boulderdash? Probably outdoors a lot more. Unfortunately for those who love fresh air and real rock, Boulderdash offers a lot of competition for the real thing. Yes, there are those days where the California sun is shining and the air is cool that I decide to skip out on Stoney Point and head to Boulderdash instead. Why?Density of quality routes.Boulderdash has great variety of bouldering problems and sport climbing routes. The ability to hop off a juggy roof and start climbing a balancey face 30 second later just can\\'t be recreated outdoors (unless you\\'re hanging out in Squamish). I don\\'t toprope there as much as I boulder, so my opinions are likely skewed and in favor of the short walls (though I\\'ve seen some quality TR routes there as well.)The route setting is great and frequent. Their setters reset almost all of the routes on one of the three main bouldering areas every few weeks, which gives climbers just enough time to send everything before it\\'s all replaced. Their setting seems to get better every time they put up new routes, with nothing seeming overly contrived or boring. Even their \"easy (V0- to V1) routes are very fun, at times even challenging for the grade.The place is clean every time I go there, with chalk brushes scattered here and there giving evidence of recently cleaned holds. The unisex changing room is a nice touch (Ladies, avert your eyes) and the bathrooms were remodeled just a few weeks ago. Disgusting holds are no bueno. Nothing like scraping your elbow on a hold and going home with a staph infection. That won\\'t happen here.What really sets Boulderdash apart is the incredibly friendly atmosphere. 9 out of 10 times you ask for help with a route someone is more than willing to offer it. Whether its new climbers asking a regular for advice on which routes to try, or strangers working a newly added route together, everyone is just friendly. The clientele is nice, talented, and (mostly) humble. Spray might be a bit of a problem here, but what can I say, I\\'m guilty of giving some unwanted beta too.The music. Oh, the music. I can ALWAYS count on hearing Jackson 5 and at least 3 or 4 Tool songs every time I go there. Come to think of it, the playlist seems like it hasn\\'t changed much in the three odd years I\\'ve been coming here. But hey, a lot of it\\'s good sending music.Prices are a little steep if you plan on coming a lot and don\\'t have a membership - but since when are climbers the financially responsible type? If you plan on coming more than 3-4 times a month, a membership is the way to go. Occasional climbers might want to try their 10-day punch cards (something like 12 bucks a climb.) The staff is very accommodating and encouraging, and some of the younger guys will come climb with you.My only gripe about this place is more of a double edged sword than a complaint. Members are allowed to bring a guest in for free once a month, BUT as of January 1, they have to be a brand new guest, meaning they have never climbed there before. So much for taking my dirt poor climbing partners to the gym with me, but now I\\'ve got an excuse to take a dozen people climbing for their first time this year.Boulderdash\\'s clean, friendly environment and quality route setting put it a cut above other indoor rock climbing gyms in the area.Oh, and neophytes - please take the staffs advice and rent shoes. If you\\'re climbing in Reeboks, you\\'re not gonna have a good time.'},\n",

       "  'text': \"This climbing gym is pretty sweet. I only recently started getting into climbing- mostly bouldering, so this review will pretty much just be focused on that area, as I didn't do any top rope climbing while there. The gym is very clean, and doesn't smell of sweaty dudes and BO, always a plus. It's a pretty large space with about half dedicated to bouldering and the other to climbing. The prices are cheap, rentals are in good condition, they have a changing room and well maintained bathrooms. Good music makes for a nice atmosphere, thumbs up for that. There are a lot of bouldering problems (routes) so you have a good variety of options. The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is because whoever is the setting the routes is either insanely good or just likes torturing people. Again I only recently started bouldering but most of the Easy and Easy+ problems are really difficult. Not a good learning curve for beginners, but I guess that'll either help me get better faster or make me just want to give up. We'll see! Even a few more experienced climbers were having trouble with some of the Easy marked routes. Most of the other climbers their were friendly and willing to help me out when I got stuck. I'm excited to see where this hobby takes me, I known their are a lot of good bouldering spots in the area and I'm looking forward to getting out and exploring! I'll be back at Boulder Dash soon.\"},\n",

This place is covered with climbing walls and is the real deal with gear for rent and walls for beginners and pros alike. When I suggested we go down to the Pantages (yelp.com/biz/pantages-th‚Ä¶) to see Wicked (yelp.com/biz/wicked-the-‚Ä¶) my wife counter-suggested that we go rock climbing instead. Surprised by her \"off the wall\" idea, I found Boulderdash on the web, gave them a call, and they had room for us in their Friday night class. We took a two hour lesson and by the end we were scampering up with no problem. They teach you how to tie a figure 8 knot that will pretty much be the only thing keeping you from falling to your death if you let go. So you better know how to tie it well! They also teach you how to belay someone and how to do multiple gear checks. Finally, you do a few practice climbs and safety fake falls so you get used to everything. Then you just climb. There\\'s something about climbing that\\'s very basic and clears your mind while filling your body full of adrenaline. You reach the top, look down, satisfied with what you have accomplished, and then slowly float back down. The class was $40 each and they even said we could stay longer to climb if we wanted to. Unfortunately the babysitter was sucking up our money and we had to return to reality. Now that we took the class, if we want to climb anytime it will only cost us $15 each plus $6 to rent the gear. Ideally we would go with our kids so we don\\'t have to pay for a babysitter. While we were there, we saw some 4 and 5 year-olds climbing the walls with no fear at all. The place had a locker room, bathrooms, and a classroom. Everything was very clean and professional. The instructor was a young guy who had been climbing his whole life. He was easy to understand and very patient with us climbing noobs. Next time, I think we\\'ll grab some Thai food at Thai Westlake nearby (yelp.com/biz/thai-westla‚Ä¶) before we climb . It was a lot of fun.'},\n",

       "  'text': 'Finding time to climb outdoors when you\\'re at school all day (like me), work, or taking care of the kids can be tough. So.. Why not try indoors? First off, Boulderdash is my second home. I\\'ve been to the ARC, Rockreation, Sender One, and countless gyms littered throughout Southern California. I\\'ve yet to find a place that can compare to Boulderdash and the diverse routes set here. Whether your looking for some prep for outdoors, a hobby, or something to keep your kids occupied with (by the way, these guys are very patient and take great care to make sure your kids are safe while climbing); Boulderdash is a great place for beginners/novice climbers. It\\'s great to come to an indoor climbing gym and not have to deal with pretentious individuals who work there or are frequent climbers (sadly, this is a rare find within the climbing community). And thank you to Christian (\"cheers\", dude), Paul, and the rest of you guys/gals at Boulderdash. Give this place a shot and become apart of the community. Age, weight, and height are irrelevant when you\\'re on the wall (with the exception of the \"extremes\" of each category). Go climb!'},\n",

I was properly explained the safety precautions to take, the correct way to climb, how my shoes should feel, how my harness should fit, etc. When I came to climb for my first time at another rock climbing gym, they pretty much said 'have at it, have fun!' and I was off. Although there are mats and harnesses etc, it can be dangerous to go out there and not know what you're doing or how to properly put on your equipment. I felt so safe at this gym and I really thought that the staff really took care of me to make sure I had a safe and fun time. This gym is not only HUGE, it has something for all skill levels. They have walls for children, and great staff members that stay with the kids and help them climb. Something I really liked is that they clearly label the difficulty of each climb and my sister (who has a pass and goes often) says that they change the routes frequently so you're always doing something different.

       "  'text': 'I have been a Boulderdash member for a couple of months now, and I enjoy the gym a lot. The staff is really amazing & they make it a blast to come here! (Darren, Matt, Spencer, Aaron, KJ, & Gabe) I don\\'t live close to Boulderdash anymore so I drove over to take my Lead test today, after working 15 1/2 hours for the day, I just wanted to take my lead test & climb a bit then go home. I get to the gym (it\\'s 8:48 a lead test only takes 10 minutes, if that), I walk up to Andrea, and tell her in a friendly way \"I\\'m ready to take my lead test!\" She looks at me and says \"yeah sorry I don\\'t do lead tests after 9.\" Then shrugs her shoulders. I have taken a lead test, and watched my buddies take their lead tests after 9 with the other certified test employees. So it did kind of come as a surprise and I don\\'t really think I shouldn\\'t get the chance to take my test just because of someone not wanting to do something. Especially when it\\'s not just a 10 minute drive from home. It sucks because I love Boulderdash and have gotten about 5 people to sign up for memberships. Everyone else is really great, they truly make Boulderdash a fun & great place to go. I just think there was time to do my test, and it also wasn\\'t even 9 yet. I still love this gym & recommend people go here.'},\n",

       "  'text': \"This place is an absolute last resort, must climb now, the weather completely sucks, and I'm stuck in the valley for some reason experience. The route setting is truly the worst I've ever experienced in my decades of climbing. To say the ratings are inconsistent is giving them too much credit. Easy climbs that have loose holds and require far more technical insight than makes any sense. Then supposedly hard routes that send blindfolded. Frankly, I don't really care about climbs on the harder end of the spectrum (10+) that are soft, but when a 5.7 climb has a bunch of crimps, high steps, smears, and even dynos, it just plain unsafe. That's no way to build confidence in climbers. But the real problem with this place is that it's unsafe, which is really the most critical aspect of an indoor climbing gym. The staff is absent. Once you pass the front desk you will never see any one walking around monitoring for safety -- and given how many newbies riddle this joint, it's unfathomable how inept and self-involved they are. Most of the time talking amongst themselves, while I've watched people in the gym for their first or second time making life threatening mistakes. Only gym in the city that requires ATC and forbids Grigri. Supposedly something about insurance -- well if that's the case, your insurance blows and you might want to train your staff to spend more time keeping an eye on the clients. Whoever handles the insurance for Stronghold, Cliffs of Id, and Sender -- give them a call. Stupid policy to not allow Grigris. Ignorant or negligent staff, that reak of arrogance and minimal actual climbing experience. Lead ropes that should be retired. The worst route setting in the city by a stretch. \\xa0Not just a leaky faucet in the bathroom, but a broken one -- staff doesn't seem to care; hey guys -- the sign on the mirror ain't cutting it, the faucet is broken no amount of fiddling with the handle will change that. Did I mention this place is unsafe and the route setting is wack. The only good thing about this place is the parking. Period.\"},\n",

Cons: Staff does not monitor activity. In 4 hours of being there, 1 staff member walked around. Safety should be a #1 priority at all climbing gyms and I watched 4 separate belayers belay incorrectly (brake hand came off the rope EVERY TIME). Staff only came to climbing/bouldering section to give belay tests. Putting one more person on staff to stay on the floor and monitor would be wise and highly recommended. Those who are belay certified are given a TINY orange zip tie, which isn't a clear or visible enough indication of certification.Would be nice to have FREE staff belays, especially for the price paid for entrance. Just my thought. Overall, good place to get your climb on but I was put off by how lax the staff is about safety and the horror of the unsafe belaying they allow!\"},\n",

       "  'text': \"The climbing itself is fine, but I'm gonna agree with another reviewer that the staff are the reason why I dislike coming to Boulderdash. I've visited 3 times so far, and not once has a staff member greeted me when I walked in, even when I smiled at them or we made eye contact. I felt unwanted on my first visit (foo, you want my money or nah?), belittled when purchasing my 10-pass (...why?!), and one staff guy thoroughly creeped me out and made me want to hide every part of my body. And that was just my first visit. Last week I was ignored by 3 workers who watched me walk in and then looked away to continue their conversation. Triple diss, yay, just what I wanted after driving an hour after work to get here. Every visit to Boulderdash makes me regret having purchased a 10-visit pass on my first day. Unfortunately I still have visits left on that 10-pass so I'll need to come here and deal with the creepiness/rudeness/arrogance/being ignored (every visit is different to always keep you on your toes!) until those run out. It's no wonder why so many people in the SFV choose to drive to Top Out in Santa Clarita 3-4x/week rather than climbing at their local Boulderdash. Yes, Boulderdash has more variety climbing-wise, but if you actually want to enjoy your sessions without dealing with snobby, creepy, or condescending staff, go to Top Out.\"},\n",

The bouldering area is a decent size but quantity does not make up for it's lack of quality. I'm a moderate climber (V4-V6) and have a few years experience indoors and outside. On warming up and getting my shoulders ready jugs on 3 separate V1 slipped out of place. I would ask for a T-bar to tighten it myself but when I have in the past the gyms staff flat out ignores me. After warming up I quickly realized how poorly the routes were set. The majority of anything above a V4 heavily relies on reachy moves to increase difficulty.

       "  'text': \"First time climbing? Wondering about the staff? How about a party for ADULTS?Wondering about the facility in it's entirety? Wondering why I'm giving it a 5-star review? Then read on...My husband was turning thirty and he wanted to do a repeat of last year's active birthday (games at the park then karaoke bar). But of course, I wasn't going to have 30 be an ordinary repeat of 29... Also, I was worried about the rain. So, with the fact that he and I always wanted to try rock climbing, I yelped and found this gem!BOOKING PROCESS: Their website is very detailed. It pretty much walks you through the process of taking classes, what to do when it's your first time, booking parties, etc. I was a little concerned about the fact that the reviews on yelp only covered kids' parties. After making the phone call to book it, I was immediately relieved as the person I spoke to on the phone explained that adults, beginners, and kiddos would have an awesome time! AND INDEED IT WAS AN AWESOME TIME! I had to send them a list of climbers so they can have the proper belayer to climber ratio. Just a tip, make sure everyone in your party fills out the waiver online prior to walking in in-order to expedite the check-in process. Parties are booked for only 2-hours and filling out those waivers in person eats up precious climbing time. 30-mins of that two hours will be spent in a spacious room for the party to enjoy some grub, cake, ice cream, or whatever the party in your tummy desires.STAFF: From start to finish, I commend the Boulderdash staff! The dude I spoke to on the phone was super friendly. I spoke to someone else on the phone to make some last minute changes and he was very helpful as well! When we got to the gym, they were very detailed with the rules, the timeline, etc. They didn't make any one of us feel rushed! A lot of us were first time climbers and they made all of us feel comfortable. They were EXTREMELY ENCOURAGING!THE CLIMB: We felt very safe and secure. They have plenty of roped climbs and the option to use the hook thinggy (yeah I'm a noob). They also have a bouldering section which had thick padding on the bottom to break your fall! They had different rated climbs with colored climbs for more of a challenge. They also have a crack wall for those who want to practice that type of climbing.OVERALL, I had a wonderful experience from start to finish! It was quite a difficult task planning a surprise party for my husband with 16 other people involved (not to mention someone literally asked him if he was going to go climbing on his birthday even after I've told everyone it was a surprise. Luckily he didn't pick up on it)... The staff at Boulderdash along with a few close friends and family helped put together a wonderful surprise for the hubby. Thank you guys so much for a memorable experience! Thanks for hookin' up my husband with a gift of your own as well!For those yelpers who are still not convinced, just know, a good percentage of the 16-climbers from that day are already planning their next visit ;)\"},\n",

       "  'text': \"It's taken a while for the review, but I have to thank Boulderdash for launching our family's love of climbing! \\xa0It's really an wonderful community here. \\xa0Boulderdash SFV came to my radar when it first opened after my kids (9 and 11 at that time) had been itching for a place closer to home to learn climbing after we'd hosted a climbing birthday party in WLA. Over the last two years, we have moved from signing up for kid classes to hosting a birthday party with over 25 kids to taking belay classes (initially so we could belay the kids but now we often go without them!) to visit punch cards to membership, and most recently to learning lead climbing. \\xa0I don't think it would have happened it if weren't for the enthusiasm and support of both the staff and the fellow climbers here. \\xa0In my experience, the staff has been friendly and approachable. \\xa0I have never been made to feel like I couldn't ask a question, raise a concern, or ask for beta on something I was struggling with. \\xa0The few times we reported loose holds, they were immediately addressed. \\xa0There is very much a culture in the gym of climbers encouraging and sharing with each other. \\xa0The belay and lead classes we took with John and Matt were great, really focused on safety and technique. \\xa0It's actually a good thing that Boulderdash requires testing on a different day than class to earn belay or lead certification. \\xa0Climbing is of course by nature dangerous, and I was particularly impressed as a parent in seeing how Matt worked with our 14 year old daughter in the lead climbing class. \\xa0Sure, when we were first starting, I had wished that there were more weekend climb classes for those who just wanted to get on the walls without having to book private lessons or find time during a weeknight. \\xa0While I have mixed feelings about how it may limit access for those who just want to try it, climbing is still a sport, and I can't say I've seen too many negative reviews out there that there are limited drop ins for gymnastics or soccer or classes at conventional fitness centers. \\xa0Over and over, I have seen the Boulderdash staff be terrific with both new and regular climbers: I even held a team building event for our office here a few months ago with rave reviews from every one of my staff and colleagues who came out. \\xa0Having now climbed at quite a number of other gyms in LA and OC, as well as in places across the country, I have come to appreciate the route setting and the general community of Boulderdash, and am happy that it has become our home gym.\"},\n",

A couple things I wish were different, I wish that members had access to free equipment rentals, since we're already paying the membership fee. I wish there was an option to bring a guest. I have a ton of friends who I hope to turn onto climbing, but coming in the first time isn't necessarily easy because they haven't passed the belay test, and it's quite expensive to come in just once.

       "  'text': 'I needed to find something for my daughter\\'s 8th birthday party, on less than two weeks notice. \\xa0(Yeah, we procrastinated a bit.) \\xa0She climbs on everything and is outdoorsy, so I thought of renting a climbing wall to come to our house, but my online searching turned up Boulderdash. \\xa0It seemed simpler and safer to go to an indoor climbing place. \\xa0They were able to accommodate us on relatively short notice. \\xa0We had about ten kids and a few of the parents also tried climbing. \\xa0The package was two hours, including 90 minutes of climbing time (wearing a harness, guided by a staff member) then 30 minutes in a side room for food, cake, etc. \\xa0You bring your own food/drinks, whatever. \\xa0They had a good ratio of staff to guests, less than 5 to 1, so three of our group were climbing at a time, and there was not too much waiting. \\xa0I thought there\\'d be some significant pre-climb instruction, but there was not, and it did not seem needed, was pretty easy to figure out. \\xa0I felt everything was safe the whole time. \\xa0Kids can wear sneakers, though the place also rents climbing shoes. \\xa0I was worried a bit that the kids might be too young to climb in that environment or to enjoy/appreciate it, but they all did fine. \\xa0Everyone had a good time, the kids got exercise and had fun and challenged their fears (they climbed pretty high), and a number of parents were complimenting the idea afterwards. \\xa0We used the party room for about 30 minutes past our reserved time, but there was no one waiting and the staff did not rush us. \\xa0I\\'m interested in taking the kids back, and doing some climbing myself, and I saw they had a kids summer camp which I might look into. \\xa0I\\'m giving it four stars for two reasons.First, at the end of the climbing time, I approached one of the staff who had been chatting with a parent for a few minutes, and asked him if he could guide one of the kids for one last climb. \\xa0He checked the time and said it was too late (that was just a few seconds to the 90 minute mark). \\xa0IMO, knowing he had spent the last 5 minutes of the climb time chatting away instead of looking for climbers who wanted one last climb, he should have accommodated this request. \\xa0Alternatively, if he\\'s going to be a stickler to the minute on climbing time, he should have spent the last five minutes looking for climbers who wanted one more climb instead of chatting the time away.Also, I tried climbing myself and, before doing so, I asked a staff member if I should wear climbing shoes instead of my sneakers. \\xa0He said he recommended climbing shoes if I was really serious about climbing. \\xa0To me, that sounds like the difference is small, but worth investing in when you get serious about climbing. \\xa0Based on that, I stuck with the sneakers, but then I struggled up a couple routes and was told by another staff it was because I did not have climbing shoes that would have made a big difference. \\xa0By then, it was too late to be worth renting them. \\xa0So, um...thanks? \\xa0I would have had them already had the first staff member simply told me they would help a lot. \\xa0Also, had the other staff member who belayed me told me when I approached him for the first climb wearing my own shoes, \"Hey, this will be easier if you go rent climbing shoes,\" instead of waiting till after I struggled for two routes to say anything, I would again have gone and gotten the shoes. \\xa0So, there was a lapse in communication that marred the experience a bit.Overall, though, it was a good experience and I\\'d recommend it for a kids party or just for climbing.'},\n",

I actually think I like it better than Westlake, and now I'm wishing I still lived in the area! The climbing space is plentiful, and I love that there are so many top rope options. The other location has an area with few, if any, top ropes which is intended as a lead climb area. This gym has top ropes alongside lead climbs, which gives so many more climbing options. I used to go climbing when the gym was super climbing and grew a little frustrated by having to wait for a rope to be freed up, but I don't imagine that being as big of an issue at this place. What most impressed me, however, was the free-standing tower in the middle that offers FOUR different crack climbs! I have never seen that anywhere, and I would come back just to give that a try. If you are into bouldering (I, personally, am not), the bouldering area is quite large as well. Definitely give this gym a try!\"},\n",

My four year old daughter wanted to rock climb for the first time, and we went to Boulderdash not knowing what to do or expect but wanting to help her to try something she was interested in. The extremely professional staff accommodated us on the fly. My daughter became afraid once it was time to climb. But Cat took time to quickly and gently build a rapport with my daughter, and ever-patiently worked as her belay to help her make it to the top. My daughter left feeling accomplished and more confident thanks to Cat's positivity and encouragement. The facility (including the bathroom) is extremely clean. Plenty of space, great lighting, and a stimulating array of climb options. While we were there, we saw kids and parents, couples, novices, and advanced climbers. Lots of smiles everywhere. Great, positive atmosphere. Whether you've rock climbed before or not, Boulderdash is a must-visit. We're so glad we did, and can't wait to go back.\"},\n",

As for bouldering gyms go, Bridges is amazing!They reset routes every week, so you never run out of problems to attempt. The problem designations (V1, V2, etc) are pretty on-point as for the difficulty of the sets. As someone who has just graduated to V2 problem sets, I know I will be coming back to Bridges to continue leveling up.The professionals are knowledgeable and helpful and the facilities are well-maintained. There's a weight room and treadmills upstairs, and the bathrooms are always clean and well-stocked (not to mention the sauna!!).Cost-wise, Bridges is pretty typical of climbing gyms and offers discounts for college students and commuters across a bridge. They often have Groupon deals, and if you're new, you can try it for free using a member's bottomless new climber passes! Heads up, it also costs $5 to rent both a chalk bag and shoes.\"},\n",

What\\'s pretty cool is that if it\\'s your first time at Bridges, you can go in, free of charge (but I believe you have to have a member take you in), and it doesn\\'t even take up the member\\'s guest pass. Another thing that I found interesting is that once you climb to the top of a wall, you can climb over the wall where they have a platform for you to walk to a \"ladder\" to take you down; this is something I have not seen before at other rock climbing locations. Additionally, there are also some standard gym equipment for you to use, like many other rock climbing gyms I\\'ve been to. The gym itself is not huge, but is sizeable enough to not feel crowded with other climbers in the gym.One thing to note is that the shoes for rental are in women\\'s sizes, so if you\\'re a dude, order one size up!Having been at both Ironworks and Bridges now, I think I\\'m a pretty big fan of Bridges, just because of the sheer amount of wallspace for bouldering.

       "  'text': \"This has been my home gym for the past 3 years, and I could not love it more! It may not have all the bells and whistles of a Planet Granite or Touchstone gym, but it makes up for it with a tightly knit but extremely welcoming community (and of course some righteous slacklining).Just to be clear - Bridges is a bouldering gym. They do have some toproping in the back, but this is more for kids' birthday parties than anything.The reason that the routesetting is so awesome here is that they reset at least one wall every Tuesday, so you never run out of new problems! Each wall stays up for about a month so you have ample time to work on any given problem. Plenty of slab, overhangs at varying degrees, and a pretty decent-sized cave considering the size of the gym. They do tend to grade a little easier, but I think they're addressing this issue by allowing climbers to grade a problem themselves during the first week that is up, then putting up the official grade based on consensus. Pretty cool system!This gym is very friendly to beginners. For starters, there's a 3-day pass for ~$30 on Groupon! They also have an introductory class that seems very helpful from what I've overheard during my sessions. Additionally, climbers here are super-helpful if you're struggling with the beta, and not condescending at all. That's what I love about climbing... even though it's an individual sport, there's no sense of competition between climbers; we're all just trying to get up that rock!As far as membership goes, Bridges is the most budget-friendly option. For those of you who commute across a bridge (waddup Vallejo), annual membership is only $360, which is a steal! They also have semester memberships available for students.Their other workout areas are pretty nice. I like that there are always slacklines up. The weightlifting section is much-improved since they added that huge power rack. Plenty of hangboards that you can swap out too! There are several treadmills and rowing machines upstairs for those of you who actually like cardio :PLockers and bathrooms are decent. Sauna room is nice. Towels available at the front desk!Parking is just ok. They have their own lot, but it's small and cramped. The gym is right across from the super-busy 99 Ranch plaza, but I can usually find residential parking within a few blocks.\"},\n",

I love seeing the different styles of the setters and climbing their routes. The walls here are tall!! Definitely takes some getting used to from what I see at my home gyms. Made finishing some problems a little hard because although I rock climb, I am afraid of heights. I think all it takes is a couple good falls from close to the top to improve my confidence a little. On the side of the rocks is an area for slack lining. My home gym only has one slack line. It was very cool seeing slack lines with different lengths, tightness, and hight. Much easy to get into slack lining here and a bit easier to progress as a beginner. Very cool aspect I would love my gym to take on is the peer rating for the routes. After completing a route a person can vote on the difficulty they feel the route is and how much they like the route. Very Cool!!  \\xa0 There is also a good sized weight gym here. So when you're not climbing you can lift weights! This would be huge for me seeing that I currently have a gym membership and a rock climbing gym membership. \\xa0 The bathroom are big and clean.

In fact you can go through the parking lot and out the side/back and see the gym from that angle much better.I walked in and you have to walk through a gym area with no representatives to even get to the front desk. At the front desk there were 3-4 guys all in the middle of conversation and so being acknowledged took a bit longer than it should have. I felt like more of a burden then a welcomed new potential longtime client. I was instructed to fill out their waiver form, which is what I arrived early for with a pen ready. No pen required it's all electronic and they are set up pretty high so if you were on the shorter side you might have some problems. They do NOT have paper versions of this waiver. Also once you submit you do not get a copy of the waiver, even if you ask for one. I think that's pretty crappy in this day and age why would you not offer a copy of a legal document to the person completing it if they asked. \\xa0Not okay!Needless to say no return visits for me.\"},\n",

As an organization, we had the whole place to ourselves after hours. It was great because the workers were still there talking to us and helping us out when we needed it. Because the group had a LOT of beginners, it was good because they felt comfortable enough to just go for it and try. Also, for those that were already here, there were some good number of trails that were challenging enough. When people got tired of bouldering, they were able to play and try the slack lines which was great. All in all, great experience and props to the staff!\"},\n",

       "  'text': 'Went to Bridges Rock Gym for the first time a couple days ago and I was pretty bummed that I never, in my four years at Cal, took the chance to come to Bridges. It\\'s so CLOSE to everything and located RIGHT next to 99 ranch.When you get to the location, try to park on the street or at the plaza where the 99 ranch is. The parking location is pretty small, and so you probably won\\'t be able to find a spot. The hours can vary and so make sure to check when Bridges is open.My friends and our club had a special reservation (yes they have this!) and so we got access to the after hours at Bridges. Apparently, thats when all the workers come out and play and show off their skills. Even if we did pay for everything, passes are cheap and so are equipment.The cool thing about Bridges is that it\\'s a GYM! There are treadmills, weights, and even a locker room. But anyway, the bouldering area is amazing. I never went before, and I definitely had a workout climbing up some of the walls. Note that \"V #\" stands for the difficulty. Apparently it can take 2 months to get to V2 and forever to get to higher levels like V9. The service was probably the best part. It might have been after hours, but the guys who ran the place were super chill. They gave pointers, climbed along with us, and showed us around until we left.Overall, had an amazing time at Bridges. I\\'ll definitely keep coming back to boulder more.Have fun and prosper,'},\n",

So here\\'s my review!Setting up the massage, I called in to the number listed on their website, and eventually a massage person called back. She had me go online and fill out their waiver form, then call into the main office to help me redeem my Groupon in time (it was expiring soon). She gave me a convenient time slot for the massage, within a half a week.Arriving at the gym for the massage, I came about 10 minutes early, which was good, because they had me fill out another form (besides the waiver) about my health history, sore muscles, etc. Then I was to bring the form to meet my massage practitioner, Justin. I recalled from another Yelp review that it was kind of a bummer to wait in a rock climbing gym, as opposed to in a day spa...but I didn\\'t have to wait at all, was greeted immediately upon entering the \"massage corner,\" even though I was still a tad early.Justin\\'s massage started with a couple of minutes of touch without any oil--I was reminded of the feeling of rubber, and was wondering if a sports-style massage doesn\\'t use oil. But then, with oil, he massage my back, concentrating on my lower back. I won\\'t lie, it was a little painful, but I decided to go with it. Glad I did, because the massage seems to have opened up some kind of new energy for me. I found myself thinking about a professional problem that\\'s been plaguing me for a few weeks, and I came up with a solution. Do \\xa0you think massage brings oxygen to the brain? The rest of the massage felt great--no pain, even around my knees that had been troubling me. I don\\'t know much about what a sports massage would be like--I\\'ve mostly gone to day spas out of town while on vacation--but the style of this massage wasn\\'t radically different than the others I\\'ve had.The \"massage corner\" was darkly lit, no audible noise from the gym right outside, and In the background played some great piano music (not New Age, thank goodness, more like Jazz/ Classical/ Improv). \\xa0Nice paintings!Used the restroom while I was there, it had a sauna and showers. I didn\\'t ask specifically whether massage clients could use them, but it looked like a clever person might easily get away with it :-)'},\n",

They also host competitions.2) Yoga: Awesome, talented instructors3) Spin: again awesome, but I'm biased.4) Weight room and other fitness/ dance classes: Love the weight room, haven't been to the dance or fitness classes, but they look fun!4) Kickboxing and Boxing classes: The main reason I go. Such a great work out and the instructors are super nice, not intimidating but very knowledgeable and love teaching. Seriously, Kickboxing and Boxing classes are the bomb-diggity (I know no one says that anymore but I'm bringing it back.)extras: showers, saunas, free towel service, massage therapy, and it isn't part of a corporate group. Front desk staff are helpful and fun.Finally, it's next door to a Asian Mall/Market which gives you some good options for post-workout grub.Check it out.\"},\n",

The employees are all nice and friendly, the crash pads are the best, and it doesn't get any better than this for beginner boulderers. I go here mainly for the bouldering wall, which occupies like 75% of the gym. And, I'm afraid of heights, but you get to top out on almost every side of the walls, and they have varying lengths and overhangs, as well as difficulties. Ok, it's by far the best climbing gym I've been to, and I had a terrible ankle sprain from climbing years ago, but Bridges helped me regain some confidence back. :)Bridges is such a chill place for even hang outs, so if you're looking for a great neighborhood gym, this place will meet your needs!

And after my experience, I can't say it's my new favorite activity but this gym is pretty great. First of all, the staff is super nice and really helpful in explaining everything from prices (student night!) to how the heck to get started on those walls. Second, I was pretty intimidated especially because I went on a Friday evening and it was soooo crowded, but I quickly realized people there were friendly and also don't give a sh*t about how poorly I'm climbing. I gave it a good number of tries but I could never get to the very top so I went upstairs and ran a mile on the treadmill to feel better about myself. Then I mastered the purple slack line and it was a good night. Affordable prices with a variety of activities. Come here with friends even if not everyone is into bouldering.\"},\n",

Good number of different walls, from easier to more challenging, each with appropriate route markings. While we were there there were a couple little girls as well as a good number of teenage/older boys, i.e. pretty varied in age but all still kids or young adults (guess that's the population rock climbing most appeals to ^^).The one downside: basically no harnesses. Which really limits you since you're at risk if you slip, and I imagine you can really hurt yourself if you fall from the top of one of the walls.\"},\n",

In the end, after questions of rock climbing commands and how to strap the harness on properly, the staff refused to allow us access to rock climbing. If we signed waivers that declared that we won't sue them for injuries, why would if matter it we knew the commands at all, especially if we knew how to wear the harness properly and also know how to belay?

There are many different routes here from VB - V10 level. The majority of the routes are more strength - based, but they do have some technique based routes which I personally find a lot funner to do. They also have a cave which is where the more advanced climbers usually climb, unfortunately I do not have the arms of a spider monkey so I cannot climb the cave yet. This gym gets really crowded on friday nights.. there were at least over 100 people which was kind of unsafe since people were jumping every where and not watching where they landed. I love this place because they have many different routes all of different levels! You should come here if you want to get better at bouldering / work on your technique, the day pass is only $10 before 3, and $12 after 3 pm!!!! So even without the groupon it is still worth it to come and try at least once !'},\n",

I would recommend coming in the afternoon if you're coming with a big group.The problems (routes) are pretty varied and fun. In addition to bouldering, there are ropes and rings off to the side that are a lot of fun, even if you are like me and have no idea what you're doing with those things. I wish the place was a little bigger, and the workout gym could be better (though I have particularly high standards for gyms). Overall, though, there is still plenty to keep me occupied for easily 3 hours every time I come. For comparison, I've also been to Planet Granite in south bay, as well as a few other rock gyms.The staff were chill. They gave tips, but only if you wanted them. And when I just wanted to fool around (i.e. attempt to balance on the ropes, or try to do a flip on the bouncy floor), I never felt judged. In fact, I felt pretty much at ease to just try whatever I wanted, as long as I wouldn't put other people at harm.Most of the time I had a car, but once I took BART and walked to get here, and it wasn't too bad of a walk.Caveat: Bouldering is pretty different than climbing. So if you're expecting to be harnessed up and climbing huge walls, then you will be disappointed. But I personally have done a decent amount of both, and I find bouldering to be much more fun.Protip: If you're new to climbing, expect your hands to turn red and your muscles to be sore!\"},\n",

There is a good variety of different levels which actually separate the clientele very well in the sense that not everyone is advanced, beginner, or intermediate.

Also writing one because I just had my last climbing sesh at Bridges 3 weeks ago and I really, really miss it.I seriously love this place so much. This was my last semester at Berkeley and this is one of the places I'll miss the most about the East Bay. This gym is so awesome and Bridges got me obsessed with climbing!The routes are changed frequently so you'll never get bored. The staff members are SO friendly and welcoming. I just got a one month membership via Groupon to Planet Granite in the South Bay and it has a completely different vibe than Bridges. It's MUCH bigger and I feel like I'm constantly judged when I'm on the wall, lol. It's always really crowded and it makes me really miss Bridges. Granted, (or should I say Granite, haaahaha) Planet Granite is not just a strictly bouldering gym, but still. I miss my beloved Bridges.Waahh, will I ever find a bouldering gym like Bridges? Who knows. Please come here and get a membership, it's awesome. The price isn't bad at all compared to other climbing gyms and it has such a chill vibe.I already miss it.\"},\n",

Parking around here isn't always so easy either, as it's either at their tiny lot or on the street.This gym is better for bouldering than rock climbing, which fits my interests more. There's a large boulder in the middle where you can climb. Also surrounding wall to top over and a small underside rock. The courses will change every once in a while, which helps keep it entertaining! Not to mention a small studio to work out in, some weight machines, slack lining, a few cardio equipment, and a sauna room. Pack all those things into a gym and you got a well rounded place.The people who work here are super nice and friendly. There's even a smoothie bar upstairs for after your workouts. The prices here compared to many other rock gyms is really reasonable. The costs also appeal more to the students as well. So you'll find a lot of Cal kids here as well as other local students.If I only lived closer to this area, I'd make this my main gym! Look out for the Groupon deal to get a punch card of 3x or 5x, which I highly recommend to start off with. It's the best deal I've seen out there. Plus having this deal will waive your initiation fee later if you decide to join.\"},\n",

       "  'text': \"I got a month membership here when I came to visit for a couple weeks, and I primarily wanted to do yoga and Spinning classes, not rock climbing which seems to be what most people come here for.The group fitness classes are a relatively new addition to the gym's programs, especially Spinning. There were only a handful of people in the Spinning classes (and I actually was the ONLY person taking a Spinning class one morning). The Spinning classes take place in the small group fitness studio, and they drag a few bikes in for each class (and then take them away after class). The only thing that bothered me about this is the fact that the bikes were sitting on the soft mats, which meant the bikes moved slightly each time my weight shifted side to side during pedaling.The yoga classes take place in a tin shed (literally) next to the main building of the gym, but the interior of the shed is actually quite nice. Clean, smooth hardwood floors, nicely painted walls, good insulation (which was essential since I was there during winter), and nice yoga props. Very cozy.I got to do some rock climbing one day while I was there, and it was a lot of fun. Most of the routes are free climbing, but there is one wall where you can belay with buddy. It had been over 10 years since I had last done any rock climbing, so it was an interesting experience trying to climb again, but it was fun! You can rent shoes if needed, and also chalk if you like.There is a weight room with weight machines (if that's your kind of thing), and also a few treadmills upstairs for some cardio.Very nice and very helpful staff. Instructors for the Spinning and yoga classes are great.When I go back to CA to visit, I'm pretty sure I will come back here for my yoga, Spinning, and even try some more climbing, and maybe try some of the other group fitness classes they offer (tai chi, group strength, etc.).\"},\n",

       "  'text': 'Before visiting Bridges the other night, I had never previously tried indoor rock climbing. It has always been something I\\'ve been interested in, but I just never had the chance. A few months ago, I had a blast in my brief introduction to outdoor climbing (see review of Cragmont Park yelp.com/biz/cragmont-pa‚Ä¶), but from what I\\'ve heard, the indoor experience is quite different.So, with yet another SFGate deal in tow, I met up with a friend after work to check out the beginners class at Bridges. From the get go, I could tell that the atmosphere was friendly and welcoming, and even though both of us were absolute n00bs, no one seemed to think any less of us.When we walked in, we were greeted by Chris (who was also the teacher). He was very friendly, and didn\\'t mind answering any of our asinine rookie questions. The gym itself - although not very large - is very clean, and patrons can immediately notice that the ownership takes great pride in maintaining the facilities.I\\'m not sure how crowded it can get on weekends or on nights when they have special events, but on this Wednesday evening, around 7 pm, it was relatively quiet, then picked up a bit around 8. It never got to the point of overcrowding with people bumping into each other. There was still plenty of room for everyone to enjoy the walls.As mentioned earlier, since I am a rookie to indoor rock climbing, I really no have a basis for comparison with other facilities, but one thing that confused me here is the labeling of the routes. They use a system that starts with B for beginner, continuing upward through a series of numbers to indicate difficulty, all preceded by the letter V. So, VB would be the absolutely easiest, followed by V1, V2, and up.However, sometimes it seemed that the ones deemed the lowest in difficulty were not such a cinch after all, and others with V4 and above were a snap. Perhaps I was doing it wrong, but I\\'ll probably figure it out as I return to use up the remainder of my SFGate passes.As for the comparison to outdoor climbing, other than the obvious disparity in equipment involved, I must say that they aren\\'t so different after all. They both ultimately require the same level of concentration, the same muscle groups, and similar technique. I\\'m not well versed enough in the \"culture\" of rock climbing to know if there is any rivalry between the two groups (I assume there is), but I enjoy both equally as well.The barrier of entry for indoor climbing is much less imposing, as no equipment is needed, much less instruction is required, and above all, it is much more affordable and accessible. You can pretty much take off and visit the indoor gym whenever it strikes your fancy - much like you would the normal fitness center - but the same certainly cannot be said for outdoor climbing.If you don\\'t feel like climbing walls on certain days, there are also treadmills, slacklines, a dry sauna, and even a soon to be weight room currently in the works! With the all day pass, feel free to come in and out throughout the course of the day.Best of all, Bridges is located conveniently adjacent to Pacific East Mall, which should more than satisfy all of you Asian food aficionados out there. Don\\'t forget to stop by J&S (yelp.com/biz/j-and-s-cof‚Ä¶) for some of the finest milk tea in the Bay!'},\n",

The range of spaces and options make this likely a fun place to rent out for a party. In addition to the extensive bouldering, there's a small weight room, cardio area, M/F locker rooms with saunas, a kitchen(!), and a lounge area complete with DVD and Playstation. They offer yoga and other fitness classes in a separate but adjacent shed.If I needed to do some training for a climb, I might come back again. My final hesitation is their liability waiver.

While I miss top roping sometimes, the short but technical routes are perfect for my work out. I can come whenever I have a free hour on my own and get a quick fix, or go with friends and take turns on working through a problem. Besides, Iron Works and GWPC aren't far off if I need that top rope fix.2. The floors are so squishy! Makes sense since some of the boulder routes are super highball. I've taken many a fall from high up and am happy to say each time I was more surprised than hurt. Who would've thought I couldn't dyno my way up to that sloper?3. Atmosphere is everything, and the staff at Bridges are always chill, helpful, and friendly. The crowd (and occasionally there is a crowd, unfortunately) is almost always pleasant.Not to mention, Bridges offers a lot of options by way of slacklining areas, fitness classes, weights, and ping pong! The routes are changed frequently enough and range from traverses to dynos with everything in between.

Seriously, it was outside in a shed that was probably constructed by a free lancing hippie. There was no door knob! And the door wasn't even sealed completely, there was a huge gap at the bottom where a steady breeze would blow in and when there was a slight \\xa0gust of wind the door would swing open. Needless to say, I was cold 90% of the time. The class itself was not good.

       "  'text': 'I was pretty impressed with this bouldering gym. First thing I noticed was how tall the bouldering walls were and that all the problems topped out, you had to fully get on top of the boulder to finish, just like when you climb outside. The setting is really fun and interesting and they had great quantity and range of climbs, I had a good batch of routes to warm up on and some good ones to work as well.Another enticing aspect of the gym was the dedicated slack line area. When I was there they had 9 lines set up, all different heights and lengths. They even had \"training\" lines. My only complaint here is that they need a long one-inch slack line, the original style of slack line that many climbers still use.Overall, this is a great bouldering gym, and a good place to get some exercise and send some porbs.'},\n",

Yes, I'm that girl where an idea of a perfect date would be a day of rock climbing ..lol :)The whole place is huge complete with a pretty well equipped gym, zip lining, and they also offer classes like yoga, spinning, and kickboxing. However, I was here for the indoor bouldering and rock climbing. I've been to several rock climbing facilities prior to this, so I was happy to finally be able to find one close to home. The staff here are friendly and extremely helpful. It also wasn't that packed when I came in but im guessing that it was because it was a weekday. They offer different levels of difficulty for rock climbing, and I am nowhere near what you would call 'experienced' \\xa0lol.. only because because I mainly do it for just the fun and thrill..but the staff here are completely understanding and supportive. I can't believe people actually climb without a harness though...I, for one, am not that ballsy..haha. But I totally understand that when you get really good at something, you really want to push yourself to the limit. Anyways this place is great, definitely check it out especially if it's close to home. I had a blast here, and I'd surely be back with friends next time and do zip lining since that's next on my bucket list. They also have groupon deals that go on sometimes so keep a look out for those cause they offer really good prices! Now check this place out and go burn some calories!!!\"},\n",

Yet upon my recent visit I discovered that the security of a rope builds different strength and technique and that free climbing practiced different skills and strategy. It was also cool to see how challenging short top rope could be. Set up some more good stemming problems, and it'd be solid gold.The owner, Damien, an accomplished slackliner, happened to be around and was super welcoming and down to earth. He gave us insights into his personal interests (deep water free solo) and a behind-the-scenes perspective of the gym. It was in the locker room that I realized how genius he and Jeffie (his lovely wife) really are: immaculate, lots of privacy and a glorious sauna for all! There's really no need to ever leave. Palm some rock and get tired? Hop on the slacklines! Need a break? Check out the climbing vids and surf on the free wi-fi. Hit the wall again and need some extra juice? Grab a meal at the cafe! Want to wind down? Chillax in the sauna. Feeling flexible? Get into position with yoga. You can even bring along the kiddies as there's a toddler play area!I might just live here.\"},\n",

I guess this place is bouldering, which is different from rock climbing. you're not strapped into a harness or anything, you just climb a wall and if you fall there's a bunch of mats to catch you. the first time is HARD, especially if you're like me and have no upper body strength. your body uses all these muscles it has never worked before, and I only made it over the wall once. The second time, however, I made it several times and moved on to a higher wall. I like that there are different walls and routes set up so the place works for beginners and experts alike. It's very clean and the staff have all been very friendly and helpful. as an added bonus, they have cardio and weight machines, and there's a schedule of classes they offer (the kickboxing class definitely caught my eye). highly recommended!\"},\n",

       "  'text': \"I'm a noob when it comes to rock climbing, so take this review with a grain of salt. Bridges is a smaller rock gym than my normal one (Hangar 18 in LA), but it has plenty of challenging routes to try. i came before 3pm, so the day pass of $10 was really reasonable. The place definitely caters to those who prefer bouldering, as there are only six roped climbs, at least two of which are for kids. Speaking of kids, both my nieces, age 10 and 3, really enjoyed themselves...but not because of the climbing. They really enjoyed playing on the slacklines, and I must admit, I thought they were pretty cool too. But I wanted a workout so I stuck to the walls. Both of the main bouldering walls are higher than I'm used to, but the really thick padding on the ground is more than I'm used to also, so it's relatively safe if you fall. There were plenty of climbs to keep me interested, and there just happened to be a few experienced climbers at the gym at the same time and there didn't seem to be any shortage of climbs for them, either. There's also a pretty big cave section for those who like a good challenge. My wife isn't big into climbing, but did enjoy the yoga classes they have there, and any time I can take her with me to one of my activities, the better. So the combination of rock climbing, slack lining (think tight rope walking), yoga/pilates classes, traditional gym equipment (weights, treadmills, bikes, etc.) and an affordable day pass (regular memberships are ~ $45/month) gives Bridges a four-star rating from me. \\xa0I'd give it five stars if it were bigger and offered more rope climbs.\"},\n",

       "  'text': \"Bridges is a smaller gym compared to some of the other rock climbing gyms in Berkeley as well as the SF Bay Area; however, the tradeoff is that there's not quite as much foot traffic to this location so you can really hit up any wall you want without much waiting. Pros- Friendly, chill staff.- Great for beginners.- Nice location for North Berkeley / El Cerrito etc.- Not too busy, so you aren't feeling bored waiting for other climbers like at other gyms.- There's a small gym upstairs with treadmills and weights, etc.Cons- Since it's so small, I bet you would get bored quite easily should you get a subscription.- The rental is kinda gross, so buy your own shoes if you're planning on going climbing in the future.For experienced climbers- This place is mostly bouldering so keep that in mind.- I'd suggest going to this one only if the location is ideal for you.\"},\n",

I come here mainly for bouldering and I love the plethora of problems that await me on my next visit. They re-set the walls every so often so you can never complain that you've run out of problems to do. The floor padding is cushiony, the facilities are clean, there are showers and a sauna, a cafe upstairs... Top that off with a friendly and awesome staff (yay Jacky!) and community of climbers and you've got yourself a nice gem of a rock gym.Also, Friday nights ($5 only!) are a great night to bring your friends and peers who are new to the climbing scene and have them all try it out. I used to come every Friday night until I got hooked and just bought a membership. For those that are interested, there are is also a small area for top-rope climbing, a dedicated slacklining area (for when your arms are dead from climbing) and a gym area upstairs stocked with some basic machines and free weights.\"},\n",

       "  'text': \"Came here this past weekend with my friend. She bought the Yelp deal last week, so she wanted to use it, I bought another deal just because I brought in 2 others with me. This was my very first time rock climbing. I've only seen the rock climbing portion at City Beach in Fremont. Bridges has more paths than that. They have a large rock in the center of the gym and another that covers about two walls of the gym. With the four of us, we didn't get to try all of the paths (since a lot of them looked too difficult for beginners), but we spent a good 3 hours there. Their paths were color coded, so if you had no idea what you were doing, you can follow those colored tapes and somehow find yourself at the top. I wish that works as I was climbing. I was scared of heights and could not see anything when I just held myself up close to the wall. Luckily their floors are covered with this thick, fluffy cushioned mat, otherwise, I wouldn't dare to jump. They also have paths with a harness. I actually managed to go to the very top with those. For some reason, those rocks are not so easy to grab alone. For the experienced climbers, they do have a commentary book on the side where you can request for certain paths to be made.Bridges Rock Gym has two fitness rooms: one upstairs, one near the main entrance. There's a room with ping pong. Also a part of the gym is filled with balancing ropes. I glanced at their schedule of activities, they seem to also have yoga and zumba classes. Their staffs are friendly and helpful. Luckily the gym is not overly crowded like your typical 24 Hour Fitness. If you want machines that don't smell like sweat and possibly in mint condition, do come here to work out.The Yelp passes actually pays for your entire day's activities. It also include using their non-rock climbing facilities. And if you want to use it for rock climbing, shoes and chalk fees are included in the pass. Don't quote me on this part, read the fine print yourself. I'm definitely coming back to challenge myself.\"},\n",

       "  'text': 'We took 5 9-year olds to Bridges Rock Gym for our son\\'s birthday party. The boys had a terrific time on the climbing walls and on the slack lines. The fee was very reasonable and, more importantly, the support couldn\\'t have been better or more friendly. \"Alec\" supervised, instructed and belayed our kids and did a really good job of it. He was encouraging to the boys, including one who was a bit frightened and reticent, while, at the same time, maintaining control and keeping them from doing anything endangering to themselves or others. He was wonderfully patient and understanding...and trustworthy. The birthday package we purchased entitled our little group to an hour of supervised climbing and then an hour at their indoor picnic tables to share food. You\\'re allowed to bring in your own. However, we didn\\'t want to do the food thing as we were taking the boys to the Parkway theater for movie and lunch after climbing, so we arranged for our kids to be able to climb on the non-belayed \\xa0climbing walls. We were told that if we wanted supervision for that hour there\\'d be an extra charge. We decided to supervise ourselves, but Alec came over even though he didn\\'t have to and he stayed with us for the second hour on both the climbing walls and the slack lines, as well. In the meantime, the manager, whose name I didn\\'t get, was all over us seeing to it that everything was going well for our kids. I was struck by how gracious and attentive he was, particularly considering that the place was quite busy and he had a lot more to do than to take care of us.Our sons have climbed at a number of rock gyms. Mission Cliffs in SF is more impressive than Bridges as its climbing walls are probably 2-3X higher than at Bridges and there are far more of them, but, on balance, we\\'ll be going back to Bridges in part because it\\'s really quite nice and in part because the people there made it a very positive experience. At Mission Cliffs and some of the other places, they seemed to get lost in the crowd. At Bridges, that didn\\'t happen to them, nor, as far as we could tell, to anyone else.We highly recommend this place for kids; great place for birthday parties.'},\n",

I noticed on my second visit that they added a rope that you can hang on to with your hand as you walk across the slackline. I think this is a mistake, as it will hinder your progress in the long run, though in the short term it will get you across the slackline. I've only seen one girl working the front desk, she is very nice and is happy to give you tips and advice, all you have to do is ask.\"},\n",

Isn't it their job to maintain the place and make sure it's safe for the climbers?I have also noticed that the kids there can get really dangerous. \\xa0They're always running underneath me or climbing into me while I'm on the wall. \\xa0They should give them a list of rules before they allow them inside.Besides these two little gripes, I've had a great time there. \\xa0I go about four to five times a week, and have for quite a while. \\xa0I plan to continue going there for years to come. \\xa0It's much quieter than iron works, and it's a lot more comfortable atmosphere. \\xa0They frequently put up new problems, and I think they're getting much more interesting than when I first started coming.\"},\n",

I came here on a Sunday at about 2pm and it was pretty packed with people. For a beginner it can be a little intimidating cause it is bouldering (or climbing without ropes). The front desk was nice and pretty much told us go have fun and explained the markings on the rocks (which I didn't get at first but then it began to make sense how the routes are labeled). I never realized how much strength it takes to climb and some of the girls out there were amazing. It looked like they had been climbing forever. I actually liked the tight rope more than climbing! It was really fun and so were the rings that you can hang off of. The gym as a whole was set up well and the bathrooms were kept clean. Sunday afternoon was a little busy for a beginner so I might try a different night next time. It would have helped a little being shown the set up of the wall but I am sure if I asked they would have been more than accommodating.

       "  'text': \"This is one of those places that I keep meaning to review, but have never gotten around to. I've been coming here, on and off, since 2011. Finally joined up in 2012.The basics: it's primarily a bouldering gym, with a half wall devoted to top roping/belaying. There's an area for slack lining and they've slowly added on additional things over the years. There's now a weight room, a cardio and free-weight area, a place to lounge, and a separate yoga studio. There are full locker rooms (and you can borrow locks at the front desk for free) with showers that are always kept clean. There's also saunas and a massage room on hand, for those of you interested additional perks.Gym membership (for which there are always good deals happening) gets you into EVERYTHING, including a slew of classes, from yoga to kickboxing. You also get a free guest pass once a month, the better to lure your friends with.The intangibles: what sets Bridges apart from most other gyms is the excellent job they do at fostering the feel of community. They've got a great Halloween party, host climbing events. The guys and girls at the desk are always friendly, know your name, and willing to give advice on problem routes or even who to take the steps as a beginner to being a better climber. The attitude seems to carry over to members. People are always willing to help out, point out next steps, cheer you on. \\xa0Parking is a little sparse, but you can always park at the Ranch 99 lot.Overall, 4.5 stars with the parking situation and lack of a full cafe being a minor, but important, issues.Join up, start climbing. Your arms will simultaneously hate you and thank you for it.\"},\n",

Kudos to Damien, his wife, and their partners for getting such a fun place built and being such nice people*.The classes they offer are great and really informative. Take one and you\\'re sure to improve in climbing / slacklining / pastry eating (this one is self-taught in the cafe).The more you explore, the more fun things you find. On the surface, this place is a bouldering gym (large rock structures where you \"top out\" over the top of the rock) which some vertical rock-climbing roped walls. If you look around, you\\'ll find some lines strapped in at knee level, which turn out to be for slacklining - one of the funniest activities i\\'ve ever done.Upstairs, they have a loft which has a couch and flat-screen TV to watch DVDs. There\\'s also Anne\\'s Cafe where delicious smoothies are served. Sometimes they even have free samples, baked fresh in their ovens! There are also rowing machines, free weights, treadmills, and Precor machines. Explore some more and you\\'ll discover that they have yoga 7 days a week, in the brown Yoga shed next door. Finally, you\\'ll find some gymnasts rings that have been put up in the corner. Great for doing inverted pull ups / push ups and general ring work... I look forward to doing the Iron Cross one day.The other people who climb here are also really cool and friendly people. It really feels great when you get a random person encouraging you to finish the trail that you\\'re climbing. This place could easily feel \\xa0like a \"home\".I saw the owners putting on a Birthday party one day and they were super nice and friendly to the partiers. Fun Fact: Damien is actually in one of the slacklining posters that hang up on the wall.*I am not connected with / employed by / related to in any way to this business.Oh yea, there\\'s also a day-care / play area, sauna, showers, men\\'s / women\\'s locker room, and they have fresh towels available.'},\n",

Woot da woot da woooot woooooot!!!!I opted to invite my 2 sisters and 2 more sistahhhs/friends to go with me and redeem this yelp deal \\xa0to share the thrill and exhilaration of my first indoor bouldering experience; as my birthday celebration, no less: and partly to be okay with the embarrassing falls and not-quite climb attempts I was fearing I'd have...and yes I had them. \\xa0We were all first timers and Joe, the staff there at that time, was very encouraging and helpful in getting us geared right (and by that I mean, sized and matched with this black leather, sweat-smelling climbing shoes) and also get started with the walls. One sister was really a natural, she was up there in no time like a spider monkey. And so was another friend. The beauty of this place is that there are other friendly patrons that gave us the space and time we needed to conquer that first wall as warm up. Then as a team, we opted to step up the challenge a notch and tried the opposing wall which had a room for us all to be up the boulder, so to speak, and enjoy the would be view (if there were any, say, sky and mountain ridges whathaveyou: but in there it was fluorescent lights and the ceilings, which was a okay) Still, Joe was checking up on us and was encouraging. We had so many questions about the markings on the walls and the difficulty level of each color in the indoor rock wall. We had time goofing off on our attempts to conquer the beginner pegs to the intermediate ones. We got so carried away, we were helping my sister \\xa0map out expert tracks 18 feet up on the hardest wall with the steep angle...she made it...or so we thought, her arms gave her away on her last reach up top. Needless to say my spider monkey sister freefell from 18 feet up and landed thankfully, on both feet! Thank goodness, with no injury. You don't get a harness when you do most walls; that's why its more bouldering, really than it is rock climbing. \\xa0But there is one section where you could try climbing with the harness and belaying; but very limited spots and it wasn't quite inviting as the bouldering walls.We tried the slacklines as well and that was loads and loads of fun and laughter as we each tried to shake less and cross the lines with little help from ropes and we struggled with cool, calm and collected steps to cross the lines.If you've tried bikram yoga before you'd be used to the sweaty smell of the shoes...but other than that, it was awesome.\"},\n",

The floor is good, and the instructors are good, but the room is frequently in the 50-degree range. I was one of the earliest members of the gym when it opened, and I was very excited at first. But after *years* of being told the heat situation would be resolved, I have become very frustrated. It's to the point that the instructors ask the class participants to ask the gym owners for heat. I still go to the gym, because it is convenient for me, the rates are very reasonable, and like the facility in general. But if I want to take a class, I wear lots of layers, and bought special yoga socks that grip the mat because with no socks the room is cold enough my toes go numb. \\xa0And it's not just me -- you have never seen such an array of creative attempts to keep feet from freezing while doing yoga. The owners did buy a couple of space heaters for the shed, but the heaters take a long time to warm the room, and the owners do not turn them on in advance of classes. They will tell you that they do turn them on in advance, but I am telling you from first-hand experience that they do not. \\xa0On Wednesday of this week, I arrived for an evening class, the heaters were off, and the room was 59 degrees. Yesterday, I arrived for a 10 AM class, same situation. \\xa0Be warned, they will tell you that the situation has been resolved -- I have been told this a minimum of 5 times -- but, the room is still very cold.\"},\n",

Toss in a $3 shoe rental and it came to $9 altogether for a great afternoon experience.When I got there around 5pm, it wasn't too crowded and there was plenty of space for us to climb. As a new climber though, it was a little confusing at first to figure out how everything worked from the difficulty rating system to how to get down after climbing up. Luckily there were plenty of helpful climbers around that were willing to answer my questions and give bits of advice. Bouldered and slacklined until my arms got tired.When we were leaving around 7:30-8pm, another large group of inexperienced people came in and took up a lot of the space. Unless you're a cheap college student, I would avoid Friday nights.Bridges also had cardio equipment and weight machines for a complete workout, in addition to a space for workout classes (Zumba, kickboxing, etc.).I'm a person that likes to workout, but not just stand around and lift weights, so I figure I'll be back before graduating.\"},\n",

There was still ample room and the gym did note feel too crowded. They have a wide variety of interesting problems. The padded floor is great, and is really quite necessary given that most of their problems top out quite high. The locker rooms are nice enough. The staff is more than pleasant. Do note go here if you are looking to lead or top-rope. There are a few ropes, but there is a reason no one was using them (all beginner routes, and quite short by roped standards).

       "  'text': \"I LOVE this gym! Not only is the staff amazingly friendly and chill, but they ALL are extremely knowledgeable about bouldering and slack-lining (what the gym specializes in), and the whole staff actually DOES the bouldering and slack-lining! Which I know at a lot of gyms, the staff knows how to sell the gym but it's not always the case to find that they actually work out at the facility. Although they specialize in bouldering and slack-lining, they offer a wide variety of classes to take from yoga to zumba, and they also have a full gym with tons of brand new weight machines, free weights, physio balls, foam rollers...basically everything you need! The locker rooms have showers, a sauna, and are always spotlessly clean and well maintained. It's nice that during the week they are open until 10 PM, and they are open until 7 PM on the weekends I believe. Another great thing is that they offer student discounts on memberships and everything, and they have a minimum 4 month contract which is a great thing to offer in comparison to a year or 2 year contract. My favorite thing of all is that they do have good business for being a little hidden, but it's not crowded at all and I don't feel overwhelmed there like I do at most gyms.If you are looking to try a new approach to working out, or want to try something new and fun, you have to check out Bridges!! You won't be dissappointed. It truely is a hidden find!! :)\"},\n",

       "  'text': \"The very idea of Bridges is exciting and new to the concept of indoor rock climbing gym model. Bridges is unique b/c as far as I know, it's the only gym of it's kind to exist. They have extensive slackline setups from short, beginner lines, long loose lines, to high lines above the boulder problems. This is great b/c rarely do indoor climbing gyms even have a slackline, if they do it's set up inconveniently and die-hard lead climbing jocks always complain if it's in their way. At Bridges the slack lining has equal importance as do climbing.The layout is utilized well. You have a cafe upstairs, and at the ground level there's bouldering problems, and slacklines galore.The bouldering is unique to where you can actually top out and then walk down to the ground.Overall I think this is such a new and fun idea/twist to the indoor climbing gyms that it's bound to pick up and become popular for everyone!\"},\n",

I'm a boulderer at heart, so if no-ropes is not your thing, than this is not your place. You can top-out on all problems and the range of problems is staggering, considering the relatively small size of the place (again, compared to Ironworks). Prices are decent, especially before the afternoon rate kicks in, and when my brother and I go around 8 a.m., we are very often alone, or climbing among a few, sleepy-eyed, mellow fellows. The slacklining area is great and is a great way to rest your hands and arms between big climbs, while continuing to engage your core and balancing ability. I've never had to wait to get on a machine (elliptical/bike, etc), and enjoy the sauna after every climb. AND the staff is always super friendly, even at 8 on a winter's morning.Highly recommend.\"},\n",

When I scramble up and over a V0, when I've conquered that mental game of courage and shaking forearms, it pure euphoria. That's all icing for me though. Really I go there for a monthly rate on decent yoga. The only thing is, the yoga isn't merely decent anymore. The instructors love working with good classes and although they started off really good, they've only gotten better. They bring their interesting personalities and incorporate bits of their own practices, which is what all the best instructors anywhere do. On the flip side though, every single class is beginner appropriate, and they'll help you ease into yoga. Yoga's dangerous for newbies! You can psyche yourself into thinking that you should be able to do that crazy feet-in-the-air crow pose with back arched without crashing into the ground. You can over exert yourself into weeping into the couch for two weeks. The teachers at Bridges are smart and caring, and can quickly find and help the beginners to learn how to self modify and care for themselves. Bridges is awesome. The wee workout center upstairs seems small, but it's never been overcrowded. If you know how to lift weights, then it has everything you need except for good options for doing pull ups. That's what the huge amount of bouldering and rock climbing walls are for. Climb a wall or eight, and your back is strong. Then head upstairs to do some curls and sit-ups, etc. and you have a pretty amazing workout.\\\\ Never too crowded, best clientele you could ever ask for at a gym, totally clean and cozy, cheap, Bridges is everything you could want.\"},\n",

One price for almost EVERYTHING including yoga and something called Qigong. Check out their website for more detailed info. Excellent locker room facilities. Hot yoga instructor by the way. Bonus. I think they have a different instructor on different days though. I can't remember which day I went. I usually just do the bouldering. It's hardly ever crowded when I go in the evenings.

They don\\'t have any weight lifting equipment, but they do have some treadmills and elipticals. \\xa0The *only* negative about the place is that it would be tougher to climb there alone. \\xa0An 18\\' fall without a spotter is kind of dangerous, even with the ample padding. \\xa0Climbers tend to be pretty supportive of each other, so I doubt that will be much of an issue once attendance ramps up a bit.All of the staff members I\\'ve talked to were super cool. \\xa0If bouldering is your thing and you\\'re already a Touchstone member, I\\'d be surprised if you don\\'t find yourself with another climbing gym membership. \\xa0I wish I could give this place six stars.'},\n",

The rest of the place is filled with bouldering which is basically the same thing but without ropes . Bouldering isn\\'t as easy as it looks . Bouldering is actually kind of hard . My hands got tired and gave out very quickly . I can\\'t really compare bouldering to rock climbing because I\\'ve never done rock climbing before . It\\'s really cool how you can exit from the top for the bouldering paths . Just be careful of your head and be sure to duck down a bit when you get to the top because the ceilings are kinda low . If you don\\'t duck down , you will hit your head on the ceiling . The exit route is narrow so be careful and don\\'t get in people\\'s way . There is a mini path on the sides where you can climb down from and exit . In addition to rock climbing and bouldering , they also have slacklining which is basically walking across tight nylon ropes tied against something . It\\'s actually pretty hard to walk across the tight nylon ropes while maintaining your balance and not shaking . It\\'s cool how they have ropes hanging from the ceiling for you to hold onto and guide you across the nylon ropes . They have three kinds of nylon ropes . There\\'s one that\\'s thinner and one that\\'s thicker . There\\'s also one that\\'s very high . It was kinda cool watching one of the staff members jumping and doing tricks on the high slackline . There\\'s workout machines at this gym as well . There\\'s weight machines near the entrance and cardio machines and free weights upstairs . There\\'s also sofas , chairs , tables , and board games upstairs . There\\'s a massage place but I haven\\'t checked it out yet . I heard there is a locker room and sauna too but I haven\\'t checked it out as well . The front of the gym is kind of weird ... it looks like this gym was previously a garage or warehouse that\\'s been converted into a gym . The parking lot is very small and only has a few parking spaces . This gym offers classes like yoga and other stuff which is pretty cool . I will be back for bouldering and to check out some of their classes . This gym is located behind Ranch 99 . I\\'ve been to Ranch 99 a million times but I never noticed this gym until I looked up \" rock climbing \" on Yelp . This is one of the reasons why I love Yelp . I discover all these places I wouldn\\'t otherwise notice or know about . This is a decent gym if you\\'re in the area but otherwise , I wouldn\\'t recommend going out of your way to come here unless you love bouldering . If you plan on visiting , check out the deal on Yelp ... it\\'s pretty good . You get 3 day passes to the gym for $25 and if you decide to get a membership at the gym , you can get your activation fee waived . Btw , their shoes might feel very small and cramped . It might feel weird but that\\'s how it\\'s supposed to be ... your toes are supposed to curl a bit . It doesn\\'t feel weird at all when you\\'re bouldering .'},\n",

       "  'text': 'I went here last Sunday with my friend who has been rock-climbing for awhile now. My friend got this bring-a-guest free for once a month and he dragged me along.Upon entering the premises, I was like whoa this place looks pretty cool. I heard that this place had just opened at the beginning of the year, (2009).As I\\'m a complete newbie in rock-climbing, this place is pretty awesome for me. The place still has that \"newly constructed\" smell so that was a plus for me since I like new stuffs. \\xa0The biggest plus was the locker room. Holy crap, this is way better than most gyms I\\'ve been to, especially compared to City Beach in Fremont. \\xa0The locker room is not exactly huge but it is really clean and well maintained. \\xa0There\\'s a separate sauna room, shower stalls, mix of small and large lockers, urinals and toilets. Each has its own area and yet blends all together I think that\\'s a clever area design. The upstairs portion houses the cafe area, which I regretfully did not try, but I managed to use the treadmills right beside that area. My friend and I just used it to warm ourselves up before doing any sort of climbing. It was kind of chilly when we got inside at first but was gone just a few minutes of threadmill jog.As for the boulders, I believe are all 20 feet high or so so there are no required harness to climb the walls. However, once ya get to the top, it\\'s still quite scary (for me) and there still risk of attaining injury if you fall down from the top. I fell down once when I missed a handhold and I landed completely on my feet straight down on the mats. My knees did not like that at all. Since I\\'m not familiar on the climbing grading, I rather not critic that area.During my stay there, a group of kids came in together with a couple of the staffs. Man, some of the kids are being bratty but I applaud the staffs\\' well-meanings in teaching the kids, and their patience. At the end of our stay, I came out feeling sore on the hands but beaming from the fun. The girl, forgive me I forgot her name, behind the counter was really helpful, answering my friend\\'s questions. Price-wise, I can only stipulate that it\\'s competitively-priced from the other gyms. \\xa0But one of the pluses that they offered is a 10-visit punch card. No expiration and you can come whenever.Overall, a very satisfying experience. If only they weren\\'t so far from my house, I would go 3 times a week.'},\n",

That said, the gym is quite crowded now - congrats on rising membership, but maybe time to find \\xa0a less crowded facility...Updated 3 (7/2013): After nearly three years here, my conclusion is that this is a climbing gym with a lot of potential that is not particularly well managed. \\xa0The staff, while generally nice (though one new staff member has much to learn about customer service) is not very motivated to respond to customer complaints (again, with a couple of exceptions). \\xa0For example:1. The soap dispensers in the showers are still almost always empty. \\xa0I can mention it days if not weeks in a row and NOTHING changes. \\xa0If you come here and need to leave clean (e.g., if you are going to work or a meeting after you work out), bring your own soap. \\xa02. The Pilates balls are almost always under inflated. \\xa0After mentioning it for about a month, maybe they will get inflated. Sometimes it takes 2-3 months.3. The fan near the elliptical machines is invariably so caked with dust it might as well be called a \"dust mite dispenser\" -- it is truly gross. \\xa0When somebody accidentally knocks it over, it emits a dust cloud that spreads for a good 20 feet in all directions. \\xa0I always make sure to turn it AWAY from me when I am working out.4. The sauna is broken in some way about half the time, which would not be the case if they posted the sign with the language that I recommended 2 years ago to tell members not to douse the coals with water, which fries the coils.5. \\xa0They also need some kind of protocol for what kind of behavior is acceptable versus nauseating in the sauna. For example, there is the guy who stands there naked with sweat dripping from his, um you know, creating a big disgusting puddle of genital sweat on the wooden bench. \\xa0There are others who leave the sauna soaked with sweat and water and the coils shorted out, so you have to reset the unit. \\xa0Some seriously strange behavior...6. \\xa0The toilet stalls are frequently out of toilet paper7. \\xa0I tried their massage program, but after two cancellations in a row (one of which I wasn\\'t told about until I arrived), I moved on. 7/13/2013: my wife\\'s massage was just cancelled last minute b/c therapist was \"sick\" (right...we are guessing \"hung over\" is more accurate). Unbelievable - again?! Really?!In conclusion, the ownership needs to hire somebody as a manager who holds staff accountable for taking care of the facilities and maintaining the equipment. \\xa0If they did, Bridges could quickly rise to 4 or even 5 stars. But given some recent bad experiences, it is back down to 2.Update 2: the owner has finally fixed the squeaking elliptical machine and the soap dispensers in the shower have not been empty at all this week (for the first time in ages). \\xa0As I noted, he\\'s a very nice guy and as promised, I\\'ve updated my rating again to reflect the improvements. \\xa0Thanks!Update: just a day after posting the below review, the gym finally added more pilates balls (including a large one) and finally inflated the third one. \\xa0For that, I\\'ll add another star. \\xa0Original review This gym has a ton of potential -- if you\\'re a rock climber it gets a better rating.If you want a place to use exercise equipment like I do, it gets only two stars because they don\\'t take care of their equipment and the staff is non-responsive to requests to take care of problems with it. \\xa0There doesn\\'t seem to be a sense of \"I\\'m taking care of this gym so our customers are happy\" type responsibility among the staff.For example:- their showers are almost always out of soap. \\xa0Very annoying after a workout. \\xa0I\\'ve told them probably 20 times, and still almost every time I use the showers, the soap is empty in at least 2 of their 3 shower stalls. \\xa0The attendant on duty could perhaps check the soap every hour or two so this doesn\\'t happen. \\xa0Instead when I look down from the elliptical machine, the attendant is typically surfing the web. - they have not inflated their pilates ball since I joined in September, and I\\'ve requested it no less than five times. Come on.- the owner (a very nice guy) told me he was going to get some larger pilates balls. \\xa0I told him that I had a doctor\\'s order to use a larger one as part of my rehab exercises, and he said he\\'d get one. \\xa0That was three months ago. What happened??- the elliptical machine I use squeaks annoyingly I hope they can get it together and start paying more attention to their equipment and customers, as the gym has a ton of potential! \\xa0And the staff are MUCH nicer than many of the staff at Iron Works. \\xa0But right now, it\\'s definitely not a place I\\'m excitedly telling my local friends about.'},\n",

Cliffs of Id offers so many routes that you'll be hard pressed to find yourself without something to do. The difficulty ranges significantly as well, so even more advanced climbers can give themselves a nice warmup before moving on to more challenging problems. The size of the gym means that there are lots of members there at once, so beware tandem parking in the lot they share. They have their own parking lot a bit further down, where the entrance is, but those spots can fill up quickly on the weekend when everyone is eager to get their climb on.

I joined at the start of Feb. after climbing for a year at (the much smaller, but also cheaper) Hangar 18, and I'm impressed. It is worth the $80/month membership.The bouldering walls have awesome variation in size and angle -- and ditto the routes, too. I'm progressing in strength and climbing grade largely because of the diversity of climbing offered. I don't use the toprope/lead walls, but they're as good as I've seen in LA County.The people are chill -- I've had fun just meeting and climbing with someone for a single session, several times. And even during peak busy hours, it feels like there's plenty of room to roam. I've read about people who have issues with the parking. I've come in the morning, midday, evening and late-night, on weekdays and weekends -- no doubt, the lot is often packed. But I've never spent more than 5 minutes looking for parking on the blocks surrounding Cliffs, either. Even when you have to pay for street parking, it's a crazy 50 cents for 2 hours. I don't really consider it a downside of climbing here, tbh. Plus there are lockers, showers, sauna, a system training room, yoga classes, weight room with squat rack and bench press... Easy to go to the gym all the time when it's this nice.\"},\n",

I love that they also have a weight room replete with kettle bells, dumbbells, barbells with squat racks and cardio machines including treadmills and rowers. \\xa0It's great to get some climbing in, burn out your arms and shoulders, and then balance it out with some lower body exercises upstairs.A day pass is $25 and if you come before 3pm on a weekday it's only $20. \\xa0Shoes are available to rent for $4. \\xa0For those not familiar with rock climbing, they run small and are meant to feel super tight.Weekday mornings are the best time to come because the gym is less crowded and parking in their back lot is plentiful--in the after work crowd, not so much.\"},\n",

When you enter, you need to check in on the iPads they have in front. It\\'s not too bad. Basically, you\\'re signing in saying you can\\'t sue \\'em if you get hurt. Fair enough, since you could possibly get hurt falling, but they do teach you how to fall properly, so you probably won\\'t get hurt if you follow their instructions. We were given a group rate which was $5 off the normal rate. Pretty cool. They give you rock climbing shoes and a bag o\\' chalk when you pay up. Once we donned our super tight fitting rock climbing shoes (they\\'re supposed to be super tight) we were given a really quick lesson on how to fall properly. We all had to prove we could fall properly. Unfortunately, those are the only tips we got. We were completely on our own with no tips on how to climb properly. A HUGE star off for that.Some of the kids had been there before and were given some very helpful climbing tips that are essential. The walls are high and there are no super easy climbs. Even the simplest climbs are challenging. The walls are high. If you fall from near the top you could really hurt yourself bumping your body against the \"rocks\" on your way down to the hard mat. Five more minutes of tips and helping the novices get started would have made a big difference.Also, it turns out when you pay you have access to other parts of the complex such as the gym, finger exercise machines, etc. We were told none of that. Another big fat star off for that. How hard is it to simply explain what\\'s available to everyone?Some of the kids who were there before had someone who cared enough to give them a tour of the complex so they knew what else you could do besides climbing the walls. I had no idea I had access to other parts of the complex until we\\'d already left. Here\\'s a tip from a novice. I don\\'t recommend wearing shorts. My knees got a little skinned up climbing the walls.I did manage to make it to the top of one of the walls. The trick is to keep your body as close to the wall as you can...at least that\\'s what someone who was given a lesson told me.'},\n",

For the seasoned vets there's an abundance of walls with all sorts of problems both bouldering and roped. For those looking for a workout there's a standard gym setup as well as rental shoes and chalk bags if you want to try out bouldering. The day pass for the gym is ridiculously overpriced in my opinion but it is comparable to other climbing gyms in the area. Hitting up the gym one day without a membership will set you back $30 with rentals. For those really fresh to climbing, they offer intro classes to both bouldering and roped climbing at certain times of the day. They also have some assorted snacks and drinks for sale for the little pre-climb pick me up which is nice. I always try to get out to cliffs at least once or twice a month to hit up the lead walls!\"},\n",

Great bouldering for climbers of all levels. Solid top roping and lead climbing, not as many challenges for beginner climber though. Locker rooms are very nice with showers and sauna. Parking is limited and the gym is located on some busy streets, I often park along the street across from the gym.More: I took the intro to climbing class when I first started coming here and the staff were very friendly and helpful. The class is also pretty casual which is nice for those who might be intimidated by climbing. The gym also has a decent sized weight room with treadmills upstairs as well as an open room for yoga and two rooms with with equipment for strengthening exercises specifically for climbing. There is a little shop if you want to pick up some gear. There's also often a food truck that parks in the parking lot which is really nice. I have a membership here and you get guest passes and access to all of the gym perks which is a huge bonus. Before I moved here I climbed at Planet Granite in NorCal, and this gym is on par if not better. I've also gone to Hanger 18 (which is also nice) and Boulder Dash, and easily like this gym more.\"},\n",

       "  'text': 'Updated review time! Since writing my previous review, Cliffs has updated their weight room and made it much more user friendly. Most of the issues with the old weight room were resolved (although there is still very little space in the way of cubbies for personal equipment). I\\'ll briefly recap a few things that didn\\'t change from my last review first:\"The weight room at \"Cliffs of Id\" might be small, but it\\'s actually pretty good if you are into crossfit, powerlifting, or just general strength and conditioning. There is a squat rack and bench. There are all sorts of dumbells, as well as kettlebells up to 60lbs. There is one cable machine if you like doing auxiliary work on those. There are also treadmills and rowers. \\xa0The staff is friendly and gym clean. There are lots of yummy snacks, and unlike other gyms, I find most of them things I would actually enjoy (they have locally-made cold brew, among other things). There are tables with power outlets if you want to take a break. The bathrooms are spotless and have showers and saunas. Lockers are plentiful. Parking is hard to come by at night, but ok all day.\"Now, for the changes! Since writing my last review, the gym has added:-One plyometric box, which is great for box jumps or weighted box step ups. It can be set up as either 20\" or 24\".-Many, many new bumper plates, and one more barbell. There are now enough weights for three people to be deadlifing/squatting/benching at the same time with light to moderate weights, or two people at the same time with heavy-ish weights. That said, today, there were two of us deadlifting over 300lbs each, and there were not enough bumper plates to make that work unless we added in the smaller, plastic weights too. But that was really more of an anomaly; I think the weight situation is fine as it is.-A pull-up rack with enough space for 3 people to be comfortably doing pull-ups at the same time. Say goodbye to everyone using the squat rack for pull-ups!I would still like to see more cubbies to store personal stuff in the weight room (stuff that you are intending to use in your workout like belts, knee sleeves, and water bottles), but really, besides that, the upgraded room is pretty great. It\\'s still moderately crowded in the evenings, but as long as everyone is respectful, things work out ok.'},\n",

I've been a touchstone member for about four months now and have really fallen in love with all the LA Touchstone gyms. My boyfriend and I recently got our belay certification with Touchstone and everything about the process was awesome! We were able to take a belay class without any kind of reservation and it's free of charge for members! ($35 for non-members). Our teacher, Sarah, was so helpful and made all the steps and check-points so easy to understand. A few days later we went back to Cliffs to take the belay test and we were given a temporary pass. One week later, we took the belay test again and got the permanent card! Cliffs is awesome because there is such good balance between the top rope/lead section and the bouldering section. I'm more of a novice climber and I am still able to find so many great problems to work on both with top rope and bouldering! Like all the other gyms, I really appreciate how often the route setters come in and update the problems! It happens often enough that I never have time to get bored! Aside from climbing, Cliffs really has amazing additional amenities. I use the very clean showers every time I go to the gym and I know it's random, but I love the smell of the soap they provide! I haven't taken the time to try it yet, but it's also great that there is a sauna to use after a hard day of climbing. Not to mention the different classes you can take, the cardio and weight machines and even a hidden bouldering wall just for practice! The amazing thing about this gym is the fact that it's so much more than just a climbing gym. There's something for everyone so come check it out! Oh, and the employees are all amazing as always!\"},\n",

The workout area is nice, but gets super crowded and often times its hard to find a cardio machine that is open.'},\n",

       "  'text': \"I am an exceptionally weak and sedentary person, but every once in a while, I get disgusted with myself and try to incorporate exercise into my lifestyle of writing Yelp reviews and cuddling basset hounds on my couch (how I spend 90% of my waking hours). One of my best friends, Melissa K., is a fitness monster who works out, by my estimate, about fifteen times a week. I told her I was starting to exercise again, and she immediately invited me to her climbing gym, an invitation I'd laughed off several times over the last year. I joined her two nights ago at the Cliffs of Id, and am pleasantly surprised that my forearms are recovered enough to let me type this review.The plan was to go to a 7:15 yoga class and do some bouldering afterward (I count this as two workouts, and Mel informed me that she'd also had a very hard workout that morning--so fifteen a week is a conservative estimate). Since it was my first time in, I had to fill out a waiver on an iPad, but the process was easy enough, and Mel signed me in as her guest (I guess members get some guest passes). The people at the front desk, who also rented me climbing shoes ($4), were responsive and friendly.The gym was huge, with most of the space dedicated to climbing walls, with rooms upstairs for exercise classes and more classic gym equipment, machines and weights and all that. This upstairs area may not be the main point of the place, but must be a huge plus. If you don't have a gym membership, Cliffs of Id seems to offer the usual gym basics on top of the climbing walls. The place was pretty busy, full of twenty- and thirty-somethings getting their workouts after work. (I commented that it had to stay open late for all the type-A professionals, and Mel said there were tons of freelancers, too. I am a sort of freelancer, and I can tell you that freelancers prefer to work out during the day, when even exercise seems more appealing than writing another scrap of a slow-going novel.)We started with yoga, a vinyasa flow class taught by a woman whose honeyed, languid voice has been stuck in my head since Wednesday night. I don't have a strong basis for comparison, but I thought it was a great class. I was mostly able to follow along, with my poor flexibility and beginner status, and Mel wasn't completely bored the whole time. I was more or less ready to go home afterward, but yoga was just the appetizer for a whole new world of pain.This was my first time climbing other than this one random and largely unsuccessful night at a now-closed gym in Connecticut in 2009, at which I didn't have a Mel to keep insisting I try this or that wall, and so mostly watched other people and hoped no one noticed me. I guess beginners are advised to start on the walls with ropes, but that seemed like a hassle, what with all the harnessing and the having to teach me to belay and be belayed, so we went right to bouldering. I have no upper body strength (or lower body strength), so this was definitely the bolder choice (writing puns on Yelp requires no muscle).The thing about climbing gyms is they look super fun and friendly, with colorful fake rocks that make you fantasize about monkey running up walls. Mel told me I would love climbing because it was like a puzzle, and I was like nice try but a puzzle is something I do with just my largest muscle, my brain. Climbing is closer to a bad dream in which you arrive at Willy Wonka's factory and every fucking thing tastes like a vegetable. I like vegetables fine, but I know they're for my health. These candy-colored holds are no game, but an enemy to be vanquished, and only by the mighty.The rocks are color-coded, indicating different paths up the walls of varying levels of difficulty. The levels start at 0 and top out at 10. Mel is at a 3, which kind of blows my mind, and I looked no further than 0. I tried out four of these 0 courses, and was able to finish two of them. The others involved feats of strength that nearly defied my imagination. I honestly tried my best, but shit was not happening.Even with all this failure, and a lot of down time watching Mel and two of her climbing friends (I guess people are social here), I became sore in ways that my body didn't recognize. At one point, I marveled at the way my forearms felt more like rubber than flesh. Climbing is supposed to build strength pretty quickly, and I believe it.I live moderately close to Cliffs of Id and would theoretically be open to joining, but only if this phase of shame-driven physical activity lasts more than a couple of months. I don't know that bouldering will become part of my life any time soon, but I do see the appeal, and this seems as good a place as any to develop a punishing hobby.\"},\n",

They change up the routes every couple of weeks, keeping it fun, fresh, and challenging. Echoing the sentiments of others--it is a sanctuary! The fitness area isn't huge, but it has everything I need to get in a good workout. I mostly use the cardio equipment and free weights, and I've never had a problem getting on a piece of equipment. The staff is all friendly and helpful, and it's nice to be greeted by staff that remembers you. The only downside is that if you come during peak hours (at night), parking can be challenging (though not impossible, like many places in LA). It's not super residential in that area so walking far at night to my car isn't ideal. I do, however, avoid that problem by coming early in the morning when there is plenty of parking and I don't mind walking if I need to. Thanks Cliffs of Id for being my happy place!\"},\n",

When it was time to demonstrate belaying, he gave me absolutely no tension on the rope so I had to quickly try to belay rope that had so much slack it was touching the ground in front of me - meaning I had to pull pretty much down to my knees and ended up doing this super awkward thing to slide my hands and maintain contact with the rope. It made me look like I had no idea what I was doing and he stood there doing absolutely nothing other than stare at me blankly and wait for me to hurriedly gather up more rope than I would ever have to deal with if I were actually actively belaying someone.He did the same thing to my partner, so we both ended up just getting day passes even though once we were on the wall actually belaying each other we were totally fine, because we\\'re not idiots and actually knew what we were doing.This guy has led shitty certification tests for friends of mine as well, and he\\'s already gotten a couple complaints because of it. He was looking directly at a friend while she was undoing the ATC since she thought the test was done, and said \"falling\" and immediately threw his weight back even though it was clear she didn\\'t know the test was still happening and he could have communicated to her that they weren\\'t done yet.Next time I come in to toprope, I will turn right the hell around if he\\'s working the test area because I am not dealing with that garbage again.

It also has 4500-5000 more square feet of bouldering compared to the other two.A membership gets you access to as much bouldering (and top roping at Cliffs only, between the three) as you can set your fingers on, access to most of the classes, weight & cardio equipment, locker room amenities, special event entries, etc. Towels are provided, as well as equipment for the classes (yoga mats, blocks, etc.).You also get one free guest pass per month, and a second on the last Friday of every month. There's a generally down to earth vibe when you step inside, and most folks are friendly and open to chatting.

My boyfriend is a climber so we would take trips to Joshua Tree every once in a while and I'd also join him at his climbing gym in Long Beach every now and then. When I moved out to Culver City I decided to join a climbing gym because I wanted to get more into it! I've never had a membership at a climbing gym before, but I've been to a few and climbed with a day pass. This is a GREAT first gym to get a membership at. It's a fantastic gym in general. I've had a membership here since it opened in late December of 2015 and it's been so awesome. This place is HUGE and there are endless problems to work on. There's something for everyone here from beginners to the very experienced climbers.They also host classes in a room on the second story. I've been to the yoga classes and loved them. I think they also do TRX classes and a few other activities too. Right next to that room is a weight and cardio room. There's free weights, ellipticals and treadmills. And on top of that they also have a steam room. This place really has it all. It's a little pricey but I'm more than willing to pay to go to this gym. A membership is $75/month and a day pass is $20 (if you come before 3 p.m. the day pass is $15). The vibe is awesome, the employees and members are super welcoming and helpful, and it's a really nice facility. Parking is pretty tough. It's a small lot and it fills up really quickly. There's street parking around the area but on weeknights it's still pretty difficult to find a spot, so be prepared to hunt for a place to park your car.Right now they only have bouldering, but around summer 2016 they'll have top roping! The walls will be 30-40 feet which sounds so cool. I can't wait to see how that turns out.\"},\n",

Nice long table and seating area, lots of space to put your stuff. COME ON SUNDAY! The smoothie/ healthy food (D's super blends) truck was here, of course I enjoyed a delicious smoothie bowl! Def bonus points for this truck being here. Walls/ services offered: Really good top rope climbing! Good options for lead climbing too. Lots of easier climbs in the 5.10 range, perfect for learning and practice. I didn't do really any bouldering today. Bouldering walls lower then Hollywood's, and very little slab selection. Not super impressed with the boulders.... I'm a sucker for some good slab and longer routes. Loved the top rope though! I took their belay test. I was very nervous and the staff was nice about it! If you haven't done much belaying or have done a class somewhere else, it's a good idea to do their intro class. They have some specific questions they ask, I mixed up one thing and they gave me a temp pass, so I will take the test again next time I come back. They rent harnesses and belay devices, climbing shoes of course and chalk I think as well. Very nice and spacious with sauna and showers, classes every day of the week. Best music playing of all the touchstone gyms I've been to. (Cliffs, lab, and Hollywood) there was a blonde staff member with short hair working behind the desk who was awesome! Really friendly and helpful. They also have a little mini store that's stocked with tons of route climbing and general climbing goodies. I was able to find some nearby street parking which was great.

Always be mindful of where you walk; climbers can fall from the sky at any time! \\xa0Weekdays before 3pm is $15 + $4 for shoes. \\xa0Weekdays after 3pm and weekends \\xa0is $20. \\xa0Kids under 12 is always $15. \\xa0If you need chalk, you can rent a bag for $1. \\xa0If you're going with a group of friends, just get one bag for everyone...really...there is no need for too much chalk on your hands. \\xa0Currently, parking is kind of horrible (it may be because I go in the evenings around 7/7:30ish) since a part of their lot is still being used for construction of their top-roping area. \\xa0There's street parking...but that can be kind of tricky at times too. \\xa0Anyway, if you want a great workout that will make you question your strength and still have a great time (and if you're in the Culver City area), come to Cliffs of Id! \\xa0You won't regret it!\"},\n",

So let's just say 'soft' might be a good way to describe them.That said, the problems are sooooo goood! It's rare for me to be able to compare pulling plastic with climbing outdoors, but I did today. More than once! The less than vertical section in the back is alone worth the drive from Pasadena and I sincerely hope they incorporate slab routes in the roped section once it's complete! Did I mention this place has the nicest bathrooms I've used anywhere, much less a climbing gym, in a long time? And the saunas? Please, please bring a Touchstone facility to the SGV! We climb, we have disposable income and respect for world class operations. Driving to the west side, or even DTLA where I am a member of the impressive Stronghold, is a drag but totally worth it to climb at this stunning facility!

Not sure if that's how this place always is or if it was just the holiday, but there were tons of people. The gym had awesome walls with really cool angles that I haven't seen in a gym before. The problems were fun to do, and could get pretty lengthy depending on what wall you were on. Mat softness was perfect, and the holds seemed new, though they weren't sharp like brand new holds can be. They were doing construction on one half of the gym, so when they're done it should be a decent size. My only negative was that there was not enough walking room because the mats stretched so far and there were tons of people sitting and laying on them. It would be better to have less matt space and more walking room with benches to sit on, especially as they have signs saying not to leave items on the mats. Overall, it was a nice gym. It should be really nice when the rest of it is finished.\"},\n",

I'm relatively new to climbing, but I've checked out a few bouldering gyms: Pipeworks in Sacramento, LAB and the Studio in San Jose, Hangar 18 near Torrance, and The Austin Bouldering Project in Texas. That being said, Cliffs of Id and LAB are my favorites. Lots of different and interesting routes, good variety in difficulties and technique, and wifi. They're also still working on their top rope climbing walls, exercise classes, and I think weight room. once that's set up this gym will have it all!I noticed that a lot of the people at cliffs are the same as those at LAb. In other words, everybody is friendly and willing to chime in with some tips or encouragement. At $75/mo their membership is a fantastic value. If you're reading this in 3/2016 or later, disregard: Finally, their new holds may take some getting used to since they're extra grainy.\"},\n",

I was flashing grades that I usually have to project at my local gym. Tons of climbing area and each wall is different. You can go from slab to a massive overhanging wall or anything in-between. The wall is basically made of sandpaper so you can almost smear every route. If your footwork isn't great, you could probably wear through a pair of shoes within a few visits. I'm sure this will get better overtime. I've been to at least a dozen other gyms in the US and Canada and this one is by far the best.\"},\n",

       "  'text': 'Hey there fellow yelpers. If you\\'re scrolling down this page searching for reason to come to Cliffs of Id, let me tell you, there are many. With it\\'s recent opening and amazing offers, there\\'s really not much more you could ask for. Let me break it down for you.Service: There are people who are good at customer service, and then there are genuinely awesome people who are just as excited as you are to be there. Joe and Kimi were so helpful with all of my questions about the gym and were happy to help my friends with anything they needed. Joe gave really great tips to a friend of mine who needed new shoes, and gave a really thorough breakdown of their membership program for the others! By far one of the best and most honest customer service I\\'ve gotten.Space: Not only are the walls set up in beautiful shapes, but they\\'re really fun to climb! They offer so many different levels on each wall so there\\'s no getting bored in there. They\\'re not even done building the place - can you imagine how amazing it\\'s going to be? Despite their \"in progress\" construction, they manage to keep the place clean, functional, and comfortable. They offer you a sauna and shower in their bathrooms for you to clean off. Talk about being pampered!Parking:This ones a little tricky, but I\\'ve always managed to grab either street parking or a spot inside. The gym is growing to be popular so parking towards the evening gets filled up. But if you drive around, you\\'re bound to find a place to leave your car.I used to have to drive 30 minutes to get to LAB downtown, but this gym is an awesome and more convenient replacement. I\\'m so glad I met Joe and Kimi - they really bring that inviting atmosphere to Cliffs of Id. Thanks for making my friends and I feel so welcome! We\\'ll be coming several times a week!'},\n",

       "  'text': \"My first Touchstone gym experience was at LA Boulders in Jan. 2014 when they were still relatively new. I had never ever bouldered before then, but I thought it was a fun experience. In summer 2015, I learned that Cliffs of Id was opening a few miles away from my home, and I eagerly awaited its opening so I could put my gym membership money toward a place that I actually enjoyed going to since I can be the most sedentary and lazy person I know. I've been a member of COI since January 2016 and it's been exciting to see the gym attract more and more people while taking root in the community. Now that the rope walls are finally open, you can now practice the ultimate trust fall with your belay partner. While this relatively huge climbing gym attracts a lot of people, there's still enough room to move around, and street parking can still be found if you look hard enough. Of all the Touchstone gyms in LA, this is probably the best one in terms of general size, both the bouldering and roped areas, and the sheer size of its own private parking lot. Routes here seemed to be graded super soft during the first few months after opening, but I think the grading may have been stepped up slightly since. Regardless, it makes it more fun for beginners when they can actually send problems. Routes are changed out anywhere from 3-6 weeks, so you have plenty of time to project problems if you're a regular, or if you're just flashing everything, there always seems to be something new to try. Monthly membership is $77, which isn't bad if you come to the gym at least 4x in one month to recoup the costs of a day pass. You also get 1 free guest pass per month to use for a friend and on every 4th Friday, you get a bonus guest pass to lure more of your friends into the gym. The gym also has yoga and other fitness classes, a weight room with machines, and really clean locker rooms with showers and a sauna.All in all, I'm super happy to have a place that I look forward to going to 3x a week instead of spending another night in glued to Netflix. If anything, I'm one step closer to getting myself some Michelle Obama arms.\"},\n",

I was in from out of town today and they only had one person staffing the entire gym at first on an extremely busy day which seemed like a poor decision. From a safety perspective I was mildly worried that they use static ropes for the fixed rope ropes without mentioning that to climbers that were about to use their walls. This shouldn't be a big problem that static ropes are used, but falls on static rope, even on top rope could end up pretty rough if some slack is out. I believe a warning about this would be a solid call. Otherwise it was a fun place and enjoyable.\"},\n",

Obviously that insulted her intelligence because 'that's not the way they do things there.'Then, the owner comes in yelling at her employee, yells at me for asking where the restroom is, and then yells at my friend about how much of a piece of work I am for asking for my money back so I can leave. Sorry, but I don't pay people to treat me like dirt. And I have no idea what the business model is here? Treat people like dirt so they will seek your approval? Why don't you do everyone a favor - if you hate climbing and climbers so much, just get out of the business. You make the whole sport look bad every time someone meets you, when a lot of people could have otherwise found a positive outlet to better themselves with.Your entire personality detracts heavily from the average, and that's just sad.\"},\n",

       "  'text': \"I was solo on a work road trip and desperately wanted to get some climbing in; without reading anything except that this gym had auto belays when the other local gym didn't, I just showed up. I've been to about ten gyms in the US and Europe, I'm used to taking what I can get. At first I was taken aback when I didn't recognize the belay system but the woman explained they invented it (these are not the blue/grey circular auto-belays you see in other gyms). While watching the required video, I thought about leaving because it didn't match what I know about climbing gyms. HOWEVER, I'm really glad I didn't leave! This gym is totally a labor of love by the owner's father. He designed all the rock walls (!!!!), which imitates climbing outside. HELL YEAH! I prefer this 100% to contemporary style gyms. Sure, there were some slick areas because it's been there a long time (over 20 years I think), but the routes are 100% more fun than the new style gyms with colored holds. Even the belay system is better than the blue circular auto-belays because it doesn't bring you down to the ground if you come off but holds you in place like a human belayer would, which means you can work on a crux. The routes were really interesting and fun; the sides, arrets and overhangs were awesome and challenging and you don't have to hang on fully extended shoulder joints the whole time like in regular gyms because the wall imitates rock - so you use your body in the more-complicated ways you do outside. I wish all gyms were this interesting. You can climb each route totally differently since it imitates rock, thus there are no grades or specific lines except that the walls become more difficult as you move into the center of the gym. I've never climbed anything like it and wish all climbing gyms had natural features. Also, other than my own gym, this is the ONLY gym where I didn't feel judged or watched by the staff. Since I arrived two hours before closing on Easter weekend, there were only two other people there when I arrived. The owner and I had fun talking about a variety of things. No bratty hipster climbers running the place, thank god. I'd love to have these types of walls in my gym. Sigh.\"},\n",

I don't have much time here and very rarely write yelp reviews, but this gym (while totally fine at the least) is managed/owned/operated by one of the most disrespectful people I have met in my life. Seriously. I was visiting an old college friend in SLO and we decided to go to this gym. He doesn't climb and had never been to The Crux. Being most convenient for where we were, and acting on that info alone, we headed to this 'establishment'. I will just take the time to 'second' what effectively every 1-star review has mentioned: threats, disrespect, talk of law enforcement, intense 'control' over what I consider very standard gym etiquette, safety guidelines, competency, etc. I rarely climb indoors but have plenty. I have nearly a decade of climbing experience in places/ways where things are, for lack of a better word, incredibly legit (e.g. big wall, 3,000 ft, aid/trad/sport/etc. climbing). My experience at this gym was just short of scary in regard to the staff...scarier than a hanging belay on small gear 1,500 feet off the deck. Here is a link to perhaps the most time-tested, legitimate climbing forum for veterans, pros, newcomers, etc. : mountainproject.com/v/th‚Ä¶Stay away, for your own safety and belief in the goodness of humankind.\"},\n",

When we arrived, the only employee that was there had never been climbing before and glazed over the safety in such a manner that my friend had no idea what they meant for her to do. Luckily, the owner arrived - (drumroll please) and made the situation deteriorate from there.The owner\\'s glib and boisterous attitude was wonderfully complimented by her own personal mantra: \"don\\'t ask questions or understand how things work, just climb.\" This was not only an uninformative atmosphere, but one that fostered a downright dangerous mindset for new climbers, which is clearly the target demographic as any self-respecting climber would quickly abseil away from this foundering wreck of a gym. \\xa0 \\xa0 In addition to some of the worst managerial work I have witnessed in recent memory (from the owner, no less) the gym itself is quite run-down; the rock surfaces are worn smooth, all major and minor surfaces are entirely covered in dust (like the employee(s)? ever climb so they could clean them, HAH!), the auto-locking carabiners were gummy and needed to be forced shut manually (after much effort), the ropes are dirty and stretched out and the auto-belay would occasionally \"stick\", meaning that if one were to keep climbing that they would essentially be free soloing without any protection.  \\xa0 \\xa0 I only went there so my friend could use a pair of shoes since I didn\\'t have an extra. Oh, and one of my climbing friends later informed me that SLO-Op would have let her borrow them for free, honesty policy. After climbing at Crux for several hours i can now fully appreciate why the girl at the front desk had never climbed before; how could you, and still force yourself to work in a place like that???The owner is clearly unconcerned with her customer\\'s well-being and only cares that she cover her own ass by avoiding a lawsuit. And I quote: \"you can kill yourself climbing outside of my gym and I don\\'t care, just don\\'t do it in here\". She clearly doesn\\'t belong in the climbing community with an attitude like this.

Let's start with being yelled at to go up stairs, watch a movie and put on a harness (we are talking the soup nazi looks like Mother Theresa compared to this hag). The sound was turned off, the picture on the TV was terrible and the safety system ended up being entirely different than what was pictured on what we could see of the TV. The harnesses were GROSS. It was fun but after a few climbs you get the gist... and it is in no way worth being treated like a filthy piece of garbage to climb a few traipses up the wall. In my life.... my entire life, I've never been treated more poorly and ESPECIALLY AFTER PAYING TO BE THERE. Mind is blown.\"},\n",

       "  'text': 'My boyfriend and I recently visited the Crux in SLO, hoping to find a closer climbing gym than the one down in Santa Barbara. \\xa0We learned that it\\'s better to drive to SB. \\xa0We brought a picnic to eat in the beautiful tree covered area outside of the climbing gym only to be greeted with a snobby \"can I help you\" from the owner as she stuck her head out the door. \\xa0We told her we were just fueling up with a picnic lunch before we came in to climb. \\xa0She then hautily and very rudely stated: \"Well, we would really rather you eat the food we sell here. \\xa0But ok, I guess.\" \\xa0There was no welcome in her tone or graciousness in her attitude. \\xa0We were very close to leaving right then just because of how rudely she received two potential patrons. \\xa0 When we got into the gym, we looked for the food she had suggested we should purchase from her establishment and saw a wall of processed junk such as Cup of Noodles. \\xa0Other snack-type food and a cooler of drinks was also available. \\xa0A gym owner who would prefer their patrons eat junk instead of healthy fuel for their bodies just to increase their own profit by a couple bucks turned us off even further.The \"preparation\" portion was a dated video that demonstrated using a style of harness that is not even used in the establishment anymore. \\xa0It also wasted time explaining the manual belay system which isn\\'t used either except on ONE route and for which the owner has to help you do anyway. \\xa0Very little personal attention was received. \\xa0No technique was taught. \\xa0No explanation of routes or levels was received. \\xa0Luckily, my boyfriend and I have some experience. \\xa0If we hadn\\'t, this would not have been sufficient instruction for rock climbing. \\xa0The facility: \\xa0Limited hours so double check day and times before heading there. \\xa0It looks very impressive and they have the computerized option for speed climbing. \\xa0That is pretty cool for those who are into that. \\xa0The auto-belay system is nice for those who don\\'t have friends to partner up with, so I guess that is a plus, but I don\\'t feel it prepares anyone who really wants to learn to climb because mountains don\\'t have auto-belays. \\xa0The walls are FILTHY. \\xa0 Our hands were black with grime despite using chalk. \\xa0It is gross. \\xa0The holds are slick from use and human dirt and oils and the routes are vague and confusing. Perhaps they would have made more sense and been of more use if the owner bothered herself with explaining anything to her patrons, but she doesn\\'t. \\xa0THE BOULDER, is a joke. \\xa0It\\'s one rock formation with VERY OLD crash mats that don\\'t look safe at all. \\xa0It\\'s even filthier and grimier than the top rope walls. \\xa0No routes are established which makes it very hard for beginning climbers to know what to do or how to even start working toward skill improvement. \\xa0It\\'s a total waste of potentially fun bouldering. \\xa0And, lastly, it was COLD in there. \\xa0I warmed up and stretched out but was instantly cold again which adds risk of muscle injury. \\xa0So if you go, wear layers to keep your muscles warm.The cost is less than some places I have been and she does include the gear rental in her price, which is nice. \\xa0However, for those of us who have our own gear, there is no price reduction either...which is a bummer.Overall, the owner does not make people feel welcome and fails to offer actual instruction. \\xa0The walls and boulder are disgustingly dirty. \\xa0You can climb alone, which gives potential for getting a workout in, but the options are very limited. \\xa0Don\\'t dare to bring your own nutritional food or you will receive a self-righteous reprimand. \\xa0The only reason I will go back here is to get a workout and spend time with some of my SLO friends. \\xa0But I already know the basics of how to climb...so the lack of attention and instruction isn\\'t as big of a deal for me. \\xa0If I want to improve and really have a fantastic time climbing with wonderful people in a clean and awesome gym, I\\'ll drive to Santa Barbara.'},\n",

Besides the room being super cold, the atmosphere was pretty nice. Everything was clean and organized and the equipment looked quite new.The beginning part of our experience was quite hazy because all I remember is going upstairs and the husband frantically strapping me because the instructions from the video we were watching were going super fast. And then we went downstairs and pretty much started climbing! Although the auto-belay system is nice and convenient, it's so easy to cheat on that thing. When we got to the harder levels, we would sit and lean back on our harnesses, resting every few minutes before moving on, hahaha. Other than that, we had a fun time going through each level until our arms were about to fall off.It is DEFINITELY a much better deal to wait until 6pm on Tuesdays and Fridays to go because you get the student discount. Although rock-climbing is super fun, it can get pretty expensive so any discount helps!\"},\n",

Yes, your first visit you do need to go over a safety video, but that only takes about 15 minutes until you're out there climbing. It costs like $10 extra too, so you do need to go at least once every calendar year though or that training will lapse and you'll have to go through it again. There are 10-12 wall sections in total, all but one or 2 of which are equipped with the auto-belay system. They vary in difficulty (steepness, grip placement, etc) so there is something for everyone of any climbing ability. They also have a lower overhang wall for bouldering, a cargo net, and a climbing pole, so if you're looking for an indoor climbing gym in the area, Crux is your place.\"},\n",

       "  'text': \"awesome place! i was staying in the central coast for a few days and looking for options to stay active. particularly, i wanted a good upper body workout. and this place was just what i was looking for. it was a nice alternative to getting a day pass for a gym.i love the self belay system! i didn't have to worry about bringing a friend or bothering someone who works there to belay me. i could take my time as long as no one was waiting for the wall i was on. and it was all really easy to use. first timers have to watch a 15 min training video and pay $10 first timer fee. then it's only $12 to climb for as long as you want (or really, until your arms scream in pain) for the first time and thereafter.i'd read some people had issues w. the owner (not just yelp reviews), but she seemed perfectly fine to me. sure, she wasn't oozing w. sweetness (those are the ones you have to be a little weary of anyway, hehe), but she was far from rude or mean. she was pretty much just straight to the point (nothing wrong w. that!). good times! great for those that live in the area as well as those passing by looking for a gym alternative.\"},\n",

The place was clean and nice looking.My buddy paid, put his shoes on and realized he was car sick/flu? from our 8 hours of driving and they didn't offer to refund his day pass. That was kinda sad :( he didn't climb... went back to van.I stayed for about 1.5 hours and have to say their bouldering routes were ok.... warmed up with all the V.0, V.1 and most V.2s and usually can make a 4x4 with my work out, but their routes were hard, which is ok, but all seemed to be of the same 'type' without variation as they got harder, if that makes since. And the mat was a little on the very hard side for 'older' knees and didn't want to jump down from top, so down climbed everything. There were no downclimb assist holds. Anywho, cut my day short, was glad to get on something to break up the day.. but would think twice about paying again :)\"},\n",

       "  'text': 'I was very disappointed with my experience at Crux Climbing Center. When my two friends and I walked in excited about our first climbing adventure, the employee took our money and then started barking orders rudely at us. She told us that she was the owner of the gym for several years now and that things on her website weren\\'t correct, including price and equipment available. She interrupted us when we had questions about putting on the safety gear saying we should just watch the video. When we told her the video was already going too fast, she refused our request to pause it for a moment while we attached our straps. She also yelled at us for coming down from the video room to ask questions about the gear, saying, \"I told you to stay there until I said you could come down. Did you not hear me?\" Overall, the interaction with the owner was unpleasant and marred what would have been an otherwise fun afternoon activity with friends. I would not recommend this place for anybody.'},\n",
