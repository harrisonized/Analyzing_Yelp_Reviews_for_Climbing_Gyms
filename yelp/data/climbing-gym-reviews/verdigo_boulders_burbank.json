I used to always go to LA Boulders but now I've been going to Verdigo a lot because Burbank is a bit easier to get to compared to Los Angeles! This gym will eventually offer the same amenities as the other Touchstone gyms but right now it's still under some construction. PROS: - new facility with fresh and interesting walls- friendly staff just like at all the other Touchstone gyms! - although there are no top outs, problems are still very challenging and exciting! - added new seating area in the entrance and it's a great place to eat a quick snack or work a little between problems - convenient area of Burbank with a lot of food options - convenient parking structure right by the gym! - hasn't been getting too crowded CONS: - currently not all amenities are available - hard to smear on the walls because they're very slippery - black rubber soled shoes leave marks on the fresh walls - a bit smaller than the other gyms - no top out problems", "date": "3/17/2018"}

Like the other climbing gyms, Verdigo Boulders has a mini gym and cardio machines, but it lacks fitness classes, only offering a daily intro to bouldering class as well as an occasional fundamentals or technique class. I come here mainly because it's nearest to and least trafficky from my house, so I can squeeze in a quick climbing session in a time crunch. However, if given the choice and an unlimited amount of time, I'd probably choose to go to Cliffs of Id, LA Boulder, or Hollywood Boulders.", "date": "5/27/2018"}

The gym is about 20-30 percent smaller than lab or Hollywood and about 20 percent fewer amenities. No sauna, always runs out of towels, no cardio machines etc... The climbs are on par with other touchstone gyms - a little less variety than the others due to smaller location.

A climbing gym in Burbank! FYI-- as of the time of this review, it's only a \"soft opening\" for members of other Touchstone climbing gyms (so, no day passes, etc). Half of the wall is done and set with problems, but there's still lots of work to be done before they have the rest of the gym and facilities ready to go. Whenever that will be... I have to commend the staff of this gym though to let us Members climb around while they get everything up and running! Especially for those folks like myself who have been rabid for MONTHS waiting for Verdigo to open! So, the nitty gritty only because it's the soft opening and I am sure the best is yet to come. Technically Verdigo is a bouldering gym, no top roping here! The walls have a lovely color band design, the problems so far have been really fun, the limited facilities that exist (locker rooms/shower/bathrooms) are really nice, and the staff friendly! What more can you ask for other than finish up! Looking forward to giving you guys a more full review once you're open for reals! Five stars because I'm so excited and you guys killed it with your soft opening!", "date": "12/29/2017"}

After much anticipation, I got to climb during the soft opening. Because it is a soft opening, the hours are from 6pm to 10pm. They were a little bit too crowded for my taste. There were ample amounts of problems on the walls. However, they were wayyyy more cramped and overlapped than usual. The grading on the problems seemed fair, but I think the degrees and angles of the wall made them a bit more challenging than the problems you would see at their sister locations such as Cliffs if Id or LAB. The size of the location seemed comparable to Hollywood boulders' back wall. I think I hyped but this location. I thought there would be a better parking situation. And I thought it'd be more detached from the DT Burbank scene. (I also think it's strange that it's called downtown Burbank. When I was a kid it was just Burbank Mall. Lol) The facilities are clean and well maintained. The locker room only had a few lockers and two shower stalls (maybe wrong on this number). Perks to getting a membership now (before the grand opening), they waive the 125 initiation fee. Pros: I love the climbing community. Everyone is super helpful and they look out for you. Yea there will be some jerks out there but overall they're good people. I also love than this gym membership can be used at any of their gyms. My friend planned a road trip two summers ago where she went and climbed at all of their gyms in NorCal. #goals Also, they have yoga classes, the occasional salsa class (mostly during Feb. at the Cliffs location), rando tacky prom nights, free guest passes, etc.Cons; classes are not offered here yet. Parking situation is a bit cumbersome. Smaller facility than the other locations. Crowded.", "date": "1/8/2018"}

I just signed up for a membership at Verdigo this month. I initially signed up because my 7 year old really wanted to go bouldering ( she is free with my membership ), but was surprised to find myself having fun climbing with her. Since I've only climbed once before signing up here I was worried that I would feel out of place, but their staffs made me feel welcome every time I go in for a climb. If you are a beginner like me you could sign up for their intro class ( free for members ) where you learn the basic safety tips and how to get started. There's a free parking in the structure around the corner which is really convenient. The facility is new so everything is nice and clean.Overall friendly vibe from other climbing members I've encountered in this gym :)", "date": "4/19/2018"}

One staff member helped me try on some shoes in their retail section and explain to me how they should properly fit. When we couldn't get quite the right thing, they recommended I go to another store for a more specific product. Being the newbie that I am, this guidance was so appreciated.
