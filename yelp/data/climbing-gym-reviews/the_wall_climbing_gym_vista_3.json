I signed up for a half marathon like an idiot, so I'm taking a step back for a few months so I can focus on learning how to run without breaking my face or crushing my soul. HOWEVER, the time I've spent there has been nothing short of amazing. The staff is really friendly and encouraging. They don't just sit behind a desk and stare at you. They want to get to know you, they help with problems, and they provide awesome recovery advice. They're also funny as hell. The gym is always clean, and their music playlist is \u00a0diverse and solid. The bathrooms are spotless, their little kitchen they've got going on is organized, and they're consistent with changing the routes. Part of me wishes they opened a little earlier, maybe around 8 am, but I can't help but feel like even though I'm wishing for it now, I would probably sleep in like the lazy, useless turd I am, regardless of their operating hours. BY THE WAY! The age diversity at this gym is nuts. I've seen babies and baby boomers on the same wall. If you have a kid, and you're sick of seeing their face melting into their iPhone, for the love of all things high in carbohydrates, let them try climbing! I promise you, it's not just \"climbing a wall\". You build strength, flexibility, balance, focus, and problem-solving. You learn that it's okay to fall and mess up over and over and over again. Instant gratification is ruining our generation, and nothing is more humbling than falling on your butt (safely) repeatedly until you finally get both hands on that very last grip.

The Wall is incredible. It has some of the tallest walls, 18 feet or so. The flooring is top of the line. No problem falling from any height. Another thing that makes this gym stand apart from other rock climbing facilities is the climbing specific training area with hanging rings, atomic bombs, rope, crack wall, and much more!And let me not forget their donation based yoga! Can't get a better deal on yoga than a $10 suggested donation. If you are a serious climber you need to be training here. If you are new to the sport or just curious about climbing this place will blow your mind out of the water and spoil you. \u00a0The Wall Climbing Gym is one of my favorite climbing gyms in the US.

I wasn't looking for anything special, just a place that gets the job done before I went back to my regular gym in Orange County. \u00a0However, I grew to love this place and I'm sad that I will be leaving in a month. What will I do without the fresh new holds, yoga for climbers, and that gnarly cave? Everyone is very friendly and helpful; all the problems are wonderfully thought out, and not to mention the sick ass cave. They reset one part of the gym every week so you'll always have something new to climb unlike many gyms that will leave problems up for a months at a time. Also, many places will keep caves for experienced climbers, but here, they make sure to include some V2's and V3's in the cave too, so amateurs don't feel too left out. :).Because this gym is brand new, so are their holds. You won't have the issue of climbing on smoothed out, dirty holds. They also color-code the problems with their holds instead of tape, like many places do, so you won't have to worry about looking for a piece of tape in the midst of 50 other pieces of tape. Ever find that black holds look like dark blue holds? Do you get frustrated that some gyms cross 2 problems with black holds, and you can't figure out which hold is associated with which problem? You won't have that problem here. They set the problems so that there is no confusion between 2 problems that may be next to each other. Their workout area? It's all you need. They have pull-up bars of different sizes, they have a slack line, weights, gritty pull up ball shape things, fingerboards, and a bunch of other stuff that I'm not knowledgeable enough to explain.And the Yoga classes! I've only been to Yoga for Climbers with Mary, and it was the first yoga class I've ever taken, but it was great. Awesome thing to do for a rest day where you get to stretch out all your achy muscles. My entire time here has been during their soft opening, but their grand opening is coming up in a week and it definitely will be the place to be. It would be wise to come in soon before it gets too crowded, because this will definitely be the climbing spot in North SD County.", "date": "7/13/2014"}

I attended the Yoga class with Brittany so this review will be about that and not wall climbing (maybe next time). First of you the staff is helpful and welcoming which is always a plus. The yoga studio, I would say could accommodate maybe 10 \u00a0comfortably. They have plenty of props including blocks and straps but I would suggest you bring your own mat. The class itself was challenging but not impossible, the teacher did encourage you go at your own phase and offered pose modifications for all levels. Personally, I highly enjoy the end of the class. Brittany (teacher) went around spraying essential oil that smelled amazing and enhanced your relaxation stage. She also rang a bowl that sent vibrations through the room and that surprisingly felt great! \u00a0Brittany's class combined the physical and mental/spiritual aspects of Yoga which is sometimes hard to find.", "date": "6/9/2016"}

Sorry!This is a new gym that opened about two months ago so everything is pretty much brand spankin new. My hands took a beating but I could also say that is also due to the fact that I was climbing like a baby tonight. The gym is super spacious and the layout is nice and open with routes spaced out. It didn't feel like you would get in someone's way if two people hopped on at once, although I haven't tested that theory yet since I missed the rush when I came in. There's also a nice little snack area where there is a fridge (not sure if it's for everyone to use though), microwave, and a sink with dishsoap and drying rack. The routes are color coded and the tags have the rating nicely bolded. There is a strip of color on the bottom of the tag indicating which route it corresponds to. Only thing that was unclear to me was that I wasn't always sure which holds were the starting holds.Shout out to Clay and Alicia. My front helix piercing fell out and when I was trying to put it back in, the post fell out of my hands. They were on their hands and knees helping me look for it until I realized it had fallen down my shirt.
