They have their own little private lot behind the gym, but its a small lot. If you don't get parking here, there's street parking across the street. This is an all bouldering gym and they also have a small gym with weights and cardio machines. Very clean and spacious. I'm a strict boulderer so this was heaven for me. Their routes are super fun, their grading is on point and their walls are tall! I must say that I like this gym better than L.A.B, only because of the spacing and you don't feel so cramped in there. They have a little area where you can purchase some drinks and clothes. Their bathrooms and lockers are so nice and clean as well.

But after only a couple of visits, I was a convert - despite the more-than-double price of a Touchstone membership compared to a Hangar 18 membership. Here's why:- Variety of holds. Touchstone uses tons of differently shaped holds rather than just one of each 'type' (jugs, crimps, slopers, pockets, etc), and they clean and replace them frequently so they don't get dirty or slippery.- Setting routes equally along the spectrum of grades. Hangar often has an intermediate gap - lots of 0's and 1's, lots of 5+. Not many 2-4. Stronghold, which I've visited once, seemed to start HARD and go up from there. The Touchstone gyms have an even range and plenty of routes for all skill levels.- Creativity in setting. More than other gyms I've tried, Touchstone sets to force you to practice many different techniques. You can't just muscle your way up the wall skipping things.- Tons of classes and community-building activities. Women's nights, queer nights, student nights. Monthly challenges. Yoga, boxing, Thai massage, pilates, weightlifting. Intro classes. Technique classes.Now the cons:PARKING. The lot holds maybe 20 cars and the gym regularly holds 50-100+ people. You see the issue. I am lucky enough to mostly come in the mornings before work, and even then I sometimes can't get a spot. In the evening it's so obnoxious that I usually don't even bother, even though I do enjoy climbing with a crowd.Price. It's $84 a month, up from $81 when I joined, with a $100 initiation fee. The day pass is $25. Yes, it's a fancy gym and they offer a lot, but that's a bit ridiculous. Can we at least get a better parking lot and be open past 6 on the weekends?Overall, I'm glad to live near this location and happy to spend most mornings there. If I worked a more traditional schedule and had only the evenings available, I might feel differently. But I feel stronger and more well-rounded as a climber after my 5 months here than I did after years elsewhere.", "date": "2/5/2019"}

We only used the rock walls this time but it's nice to know that there are other options to try.I probably wouldn't come back solo because rock climbing isn't my choice exercise but I'll definitely bring the kids back.

I did not climb, nor do I usually climb, so I will only say that there is a ton of bouldering but not really any top-rope. Aside from the climbing aspect, here's what I thought:1) Cardio equipment: about the same amount as other Touchstone gyms, but in a separate area upstairs, away from the weights, where there is much more space. 2) Weights: Slightly larger space and amount of equipment than Cliffs of Id, including a GHD (glute-ham developer), quite a few bumper plates and bars, and two separate spaces for squatting/deadlifting/oly. There are also a couple plyo boxes. All in all, a better space than Cliffs of Id, but not as good as Ironworks or Great Western.3) Stretching: LOTS of space to stretch upstairs without having a ton of people stepping around/over you. Quite a bit of stretching equipment.4) Chill-out area: Not much of one. Unlike other Touchstone gyms that have lots of tables and chairs, there is very little of that sort of thing here. Not a huge deal though: this is a gym, not a coffee shop.5) Cleanliness: Very clean all-around, including large, spotless bathrooms and showers.6) Parking: Small private lot.

I don't know how I'll ever re-subscribe to a regular gym at this point - the climbing gym has totally spoiled me.HB has a good vibe. It doesn't ooze the pretentious climber attitude that can permeate some climbing gyms/groups.There are all types of folks on any given day - friendly folks, less chatty folks, high-skill climbers, beginners, small groups, solo artists, etc. etc.The routes are decently creative at Hollywood Boulders. I would place Cliffs at the height of the variety pool (in all fairness, it has a good deal more square feet of bouldering), Hollywood Boulders at 2nd, and La.b closely vying for second but coming in third. Purely my opinion though.Each of the gyms has their own unique wall setups with something different to offer, so between the periods where you may be waiting for a few more new routes to be setup at your home gym, check out one of the other locations.If you haven't ever rock climbed (indoors or outdoors), give Hollywood Boulders a shot! While there's nothing wrong with just jumping onto a wall and going for it on your first time, I highly recommend getting a crash course or taking one of their beginner bouldering classes, ESPECIALLY to learn falling and impact mitigation techniques (it's easy not to injure yourself, but also easy to injure yourself if you don't have the correct technique)!Like Sender One Climbing Gym, I would looove it if Hollywood Boulders would set in a punching bag or two - that would be the cherry on top.", "date": "11/30/2016"}

I totally get it. I think a membership here would be nice. I like it. HOWEVER, I've never done any rock climbing so I figured I'd sign up for the $30 Intro to Bouldering Class that started at 6 pm. I showed up early as requested. Waited around for a little. The class started late, and I was the only student. That's probably a plus. The instruction I got included, \"Look at this sign on how to fall,\" and \"Go ahead and climb up this wall.\" After my instructor told me to climb up two walls, she left me on my own. The 45 minute intro to bouldering class was effectively over at 6:10 pm. I felt kinda screwed. She went off and climbed around a bit.So, I climbed around on my own for an hour and a half or so, to some difficulty, cause you know, I don't know what I'm doing like an idiot. And, I did get a little better. So I walked out with the thought, maybe you just get better at bouldering by doing it a lot and getting stronger.Then I got an email encouraging me to to sign up for a $35 Basic Technique class in which they cover balance, route reading, footwork, and more. So, I went back to feeling totally screwed. What was the intro to bouldering? Was it literally just telling me that bouldering is climbing up the wall? If there are things like route reading, balance, footwork, and more, why couldn't my instructor show me at least a little of that in my intro class? I mean, my instructor didn't even make a pitch for the gym. I discovered the weight machines and treadmills on my own. Whatever, I may be being overly sensitive to this, but I'm really feeling screwed on this intro class.Parking lot, but it was full when I got there. Pretty crowded as the day goes on. There were kids running around, jumping around under me as I was climbing walls, which stressed me out I'd fall on them. I should have fallen on one of them...Ultimately I think this place would be cool, but if you're coming in as an outsider, it may not be as fun.", "date": "8/3/2017"}

Restrooms are kept very clean, stalls are huge, women's restroom has sanitary pads/tampons for free. Free towels, shampoo and body wash for the showers. Now, to the actual climbing. Ratings are soft. Meaning, a first timers could probably climbing V0-V2, maybe V3. It's very encouraging if you've never climbed before. If you have, it's great for your ego. I'm climbing V3-4 at my home gym, and I'm doing V5-6 (maybe 7) here. Routes, from what I've heard, are changed very frequently. And they have a great variety. Anything from cave to slab is there. It's just so nice to go and find so many different types of climbs. Everything is so thoughtfully set and color coded. There was so many people, but I never had to wait for a route. There's treadmills and cycles upstairs, weights downstairs. A top out section with hangboards on top. The membership is $79 per month. If I could afford it, I'd be a member. Great AC, nice routes, I have nothing bad to say about the gym. If anything, it's just the parking lot in the back is kinda small.

Also great to be able to go to other rock climbing gyms across the US when I travel.", "date": "2/18/2017"}

This gym is awesome! So many options! Even came on a busy Saturday but there's so many options there wasn't a moment that I felt like I couldn't get on the wall and work on something. The crash pads are better than other gyms I've been to. The people are of all skill levels. Love they have yoga classes - wish the times worked with my schedule though! They have a nice locker room with a STEAM room.", "date": "2/7/2017"}

I usually go to LA Boulders, which is the Touchstone gym closest to me. Comparing the two, I'm not exactly sure which I like best. While Hollywood Boulders has lower ceilings (which doesn't look as cool and feels a bit more claustrophobic), the pro is that there's a lot more wall space. This means that the wait time is less and everyone seems more evenly spread out. I also think that this is a better gym for beginners like me, because there looks to be a lot more lower grade problems that I can work on, and variety of easy and hard v1's. And it's nice to be able to have space to work out a problem without having people waiting for you all the time... But that's probably because LA Boulders can get crowded at peak hours; HW Boulders just doesnt get that same traffic. I was lucky to get parking in their small lot, but I'd imagine I'd run into problems in the future. Overall though, its a great gym, and I love the variety of problems. When I went, I noticed a lot more beginners like me, which made me feel less insecure about starting out. Great music here as well, definitely makes me want to dance out while I'm on the wall!!", "date": "6/16/2017"}

If you've been to other Touchstone gyms in the area (LA Boulders & Cliffs of Id), I'd say that it probably has the most bouldering routes and walls available of the 3 gyms. The bathrooms, fitness class room, and pro-shop area were all still under construction while I went there, but the place is pretty spacious- not cramped like LA Boulders. They have a very small parking lot in the back, but it seemed like there was enough metered and unmetered street parking available too. Hopefully I'll be back soon enough. Cliffs of Id is my home gym and within 4 miles of my house, so Hollywood is a bit for me to trek to.", "date": "6/29/2016"}
