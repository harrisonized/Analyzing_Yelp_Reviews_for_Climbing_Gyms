As a relatively new climber, I always love the friendly and fun atmosphere that the Touchstone gyms have. The Studio's bouldering area is definitely smaller than Pipeworks in Sacramento but so far the times that I have come haven't been too busy (except for Friday evenings; Sunday morning-afternoons have been the emptiest). Everyone is very friendly and encouraging and during a climb you'll gain about two new people cheering you on and giving you tips if you get stuck. There are a bunch of crash pads on already squishy floors to help with any falls or jumps down. So far, I have seen routes vary from VB/V0-V10 in the bouldering area with the routes marked by certain colored holds rather than tape which is nice and easier when climbing. I haven't tried top roping yet but it looks like they have a good amount of really high top roping available. I plan to try it sometime I the near future. In the very back behind the top ropes, is a nice area with hangboards that you can practice and have fun on. There are also 1-2 slack lines around the gym. I have yet to try their classes but that is also sometime I plan to do in the near future. Parking isn't too bad since they validate the \u00a0convention parking garage AND the 2nd and San Carlos garage. On the weekends, the 2nd and San Carlos garage has a flat rate of $5 BUT if you get it validated by The Studio, it ends up being completely free for however long you are parked there. And it's really not too far of a walk. The only downside is that IT'S SO EXPENSIVE! They recently raised the daily prices by $5 so now weekends and after (3pm?) are $25 plus extra for shoes and harnesses. If you come early enough during the weekdays, it's $20 plus extra for shoes and harnesses. The memberships are just as pricey. As a college student (if you go to SJSU you get a discounted membership), the memberships and even daily passes are \u00a0very expensive. :( As a side note, the memberships are more expensive to get at The Studio compared to some other Touchstone gyms (with Fresno being the cheapest).", "date": "4/9/2017"}

We're just in town for a couple of weeks, so we're not going to get memberships.

The gym validates your parking for up to two hours, and you pay the difference. No big deal!I feel extremely insulted by my experience at the gym. We passed the top rope test easily and were told we could take the lead test in an hour when more staff arrived. We thought that was fine and went to the top rope area. After an hour, a different staff person handled our request, and he seemed skeptical of us right off the bat. \"Do you even have a rope?\" \"Do you know how to lead climb?\" \"Have you lead climbed before?\" \"Do you need to practice more?\" We politely answered his questions without bothering to mention that we've been leading for years, have passed several lead tests elsewhere, and just ended a 6 month outdoor climbing trip. He explained that the test is very rigorous, and he's seeking perfection. We do the test, and while neither of us z-clipped, back-clipped, put our leg behind the rope, struggled, lost control while catching the person, short-roped, announced our fall, or skipped a clip, he still failed us. WTF. He criticized my partner for high clipping at the end, and he criticized me for not standing far enough to the side when my partner was going to the first clip. But my partner was high clipping on easy terrain and was in complete control, and I did stand to the side, but it wasn't super exaggerated. I later looked up their criteria online, and it states:Belayer must belay immediately underneath the first clip until climber has clipped at least the 4th quickdraw.Lead climbers must clip between their waist and head level, or higher if safe and in control.So you DON'T want us to stand to the side? And high clipping IS acceptable if in control? Basically, the staff person ignored the fact that we were clearly competent and climbing safely. He decided to make us compete for Olympic Lead Test Gold and fail us for subjective style points. This was extremely insulting and a waste of money. We later watched other people lead climbing, and one girl was clearly uncomfortable and skipped a clip. Was she passed on the same standards? He explained we could take the test again in a few days.

I've actually (and you too probably, if you've walked around DTSJ) walked past it without realizing it/realizing what it was. The staff is super friendly and informative. You go in, sign a waiver, and you get the run down. I just went to boulder, they have rock-climbing classes if you want to use their HUGE ARSE walls (2 stories), which are in the afternoon. The facilities are nice and clean too. There's locker rooms and bathrooms for men and women near the front of the gym.The bouldering space is upstairs, and there's plenty of crash pads and routes. It can get a little crowded because the similar leveled routes (in my case, beginner) are pretty close to each other. It's not a big deal though, since waiting gives your hands a break. They also have a small free weights area with a squat rack (and some cardio machines), which is always a plus, got my gym workout in and climbed in one stop!It's $12 for the day pass before 3pm, and $4 to rent shoes + chalk. I parked around Safeway and walked over (it's a little past the building that smells strongly of piss).

They have lots of different options for both bouldering and belaying, and they always have new routes. They do have more difficult options than easy ones (I recall only one 5.6 and two 5.7s).The staff here definitely know their stuff and are super friendly & helpful. They sell rock climbing gear here (shoes, chalk, etc) and their own branded swag. This definitely is not a cheap hobby by any means - a day pass is $20 and gear rental (shoe, harness, belay device) is $5. HOWEVER, if you come before 3 pm, you will only pay $15 for a day pass on weekdays.But you pay the fee to enter Touchstone, you will also have access to their gym ad classes if you're looking for a little variety in your workout. To get the most bang out of your buck, I would recommend coming here early in the day and planning to spend a few hours climbing; go out for some lunch and come back to the Studio to log some more hours. Happy Climbing!PRO TIP #1: every Friday is Student Night which means $15 all-day passes for anyone with a student IDPRO TIP #2: this place is within walking distance to a LaVic's and sometimes has food trucks outside (so you can eat back all the calories you burned)PRO TIP #3: if this is your first time rock-climbing, know that your upper body (back, shoulders, arms) will definitely hurt due to improper form; try to use your lower body more when climbing!", "date": "6/17/2015"}

Probably not untrue, but if you've climbed everything you *can, why not press yourself on the problems that are rated harder or just above your comfort zone? (...see what I did there? \"above\"? Because climbing? I know. I'm the worst.) Get after those moves you couldn't do yesterday, pass that crux you couldn't read last week, top that route you wouldn't have even tried last month. In that regard, there is almost always something to climb.True, Studio (as well as most indoor-climbing gyms to some extent) rate their climbs subjectively and those ratings can vary from chain to chain, setter to setter, climber to climber. To that I say don't be so fixated on grade. Read routes, look for cruxes, make attempts, push your limits, climb safe regardless. Just try things; you're your own/only competitor here.Namaste.Proximity to Japantown/downtown make Studio [personally] accessible by bike (agreed, street parking can be a pain) and lends itself to easily seek out food or a post-session drink [priorities, am I right?]. A trek to PG is always looked-forward to, but necessitates some planning. A jaunt to Studio can happen on impulse, and I like that. (Do I maybe have commitment issues? Don't answer that.)Plus, Studio being frequented by downtown dwellers, there's a whimsical camaraderie borne of running into and socializing with business owners, bartenders, & restaurateurs outside of [their] work.PG might be the big glimmering mecca, but there's something nice about neighborhood-y Studio.________________________________________________________Workout, then nosh on a burger!

I can give you a long laundry list of how/why PG is superior, but I'll stick to the macro level points:- Planet Granite has lower monthly membership fees- Planet Granite has a much larger climbing facility (triple the amount of Lead Climbing, Top Rope & Boldering routes)- Planet Granite has a much larger gym (fixed & free weights)- Planet Granite has more studios with more fitness classes (yoga, core, etc)- Planet Granite membership includes onsite Cross-fit - Planet Granite has a real locker room (not some converted bathroom)- Planet Granite has a parking lot. \u00a0- Planet Granite membership gets you a 10 or 15% discount at Sports Basement- Planet Granite has less member's taking selfies for InstagramStudio Climbing provides indoor rock climbing solutions for those who live in DTSJ, which is valued and understandable, some people will settle due to convenience. \u00a0But if you truly are a fan of Rock Climbing + Fitness, \u00a0you owe it to yourself to check out PG in Sunnyvale.", "date": "6/26/2014"}

Had to do it for Kendra at The Studio. Management, if you're reading- give the girl a raise woooooopClimbing's been on my bucket list for years. Why did I wait so long? Why do we always procrastinate? Anyway, I'm the kind of stubborn person who insists on doing everything on my own BUT I had no idea where to start. I figured, why not sign up for the Intro to Climbing Plus class and get it all done in one go? Not down to go alone, I dragged my sister and her best friend along with me. It was super easy to make a reservation online and we only made ours a couple days in advance. We got to The Studio 15 minutes early, filled out a quick waiver, got our gear, and started our class with Kendra.Class began with learning how to tie knots. These are important for, you know, keeping people alive and stuff. Pretty casual. All jokes aside, we got a little knotty, learned how to belay, and got up on the walls. Kendra started us off on a 5.5, which was a good climb to begin on. We each got a chance to climb and belay, focusing more on the belaying- safety first, kids. The second half of our \"Plus\" class featured a lot more focus on climbing technique, learning which way to lean/hold your body weight on different types of rocks, strategic ways to get to the top, etc. After seeing us get up the 5.5 earlier, Kendra took us around to look at more \"unusual\" climbs throughout the gym. We stopped at a 5.10a and she asked if we wanted to try it out. Well then. Not one to say no to a challenge, I regretted it almost immediately when I found myself 20 ft up in the air with each leg on a different wall and sweat trickling down my back (out of exertion? fear? not sure which). I honestly have no idea how it happened, but a combination of reckless Tarzan-like body swinging and Kendra's coaching resulted in finally reaching the top. No more regrets, finished a 5.10a on my second climb ever. I Googled it afterwards and it sounds like a pretty good thing so I'm bragging to my friends because my ego's been needing a little boost lately.All in all, I was super comfortable learning something entirely new, everyone in the gym was kind and welcoming, lessons were efficient and well worth the investment, our instructor didn't hesitate to push us towards challenges, and I've discovered something awesome.

I have to say that I'm really liking it! Some of it is still a work in progress, but that's okay. There are 3 levels going on here in this former club/theater: level 1 is the ground floor for the toproping area, level 2 midway up the stairs leads you to fitness rooms where you can take yoga/pilatoes, and level 3 (or I guess 2.5 and 3?) house your classic treadmills, dumbbells and the like, along with the bouldering area.The initial draw for me was that this gym is a lot closer to my house than PG Sunnyvale. Don't get me wrong, PG is really a top-of-the-line facility, but it was getting pretty annoying to have to make the drive after work. Enter The Studio -- it's a smaller gym, with a lot cozier vibe and fewer people. It's really nice being able to toprope and/or boulder at a gym and not have to wait for 3 other people to climb a route first!! I did notice that some of the routes were rated a bit easier than what I'm used to, and some of them MUCH harder (I warmed up on a weirdly, way-too-difficult-to-make-sense 5.4 before). You can park on the street (free after 6 PM) or park in the SJ Convention Center garage, with a 2 hour validation, which is really nice! I was worried at first that I wouldn't be able to find parking downtown, but there's usually plenty of room at the garage. Only other things would be that the holds have had some residual plaster on them from time to time, because of the new construction, and that in the fitness/weights area, there weren't any barbells that I could see. I was really looking forward to seeing barbells so I could do squats and dead lifts, but maybe they're bringing those in later?If you're interested in climbing and live in the area, definitely check this place out!", "date": "6/14/2012"}

I had a membership at PG Sunnyvale for 1 year, and also at Pacific Edge in Santa Cruz for 3 years when I lived over there. The Studio is a nice, clean gym. Sometimes people complain that it's too small or that it's not as \"nice\" as PG. I agree that PG is a bigger facility with more equipment. But the Studio also has everything you need - Good bouldering, lead walls, top rope, conditioning and yoga classes, TRX, a mini weight room, hangboards and campus boards, etc. If you wanna get in shape, try Serenity's \"Core and More\" class twice per week...it will help you build a good conditioning base that transfers over to climbing.Also this gym has a great crowd. The regulars are silly - they love to have fun as much as they love to climb. There's almost always a group climbing together, or playing an impromptu game of add-on. The best energy is on weekday nights between 7 and closing, in my opinion. The environment is not quite as competitive or aggressive as some other gyms. There are a lot of beginners, young college aged people, and some working professionals in their late 20's / early 30's. People are generally nice and willing to b.s. about rock climbing. There isn't too much attitude or dudes with huge egos to prove - that's one of my favorite things about this gym. I would say that if you're a beginner or even if you're experienced and are just looking for a mellow environment to climb in, then this is a better gym for you. However, if you're a completion level climber and rock climbing is your life's goal, then you should probably train at a bigger gym.The other nice thing about the studio is their setting. There are a variety of setters - some new and some veteran, so you really end up experiencing a spectrum of different styles and technique. Also the staff in general is helpful and friendly. Some folks are new to climbing and some are old school.Lastly, the downtown location is fun. You have 2 cafes on the same block, Stritch is a nice bar right next door, and there's no better entertainment in San Jose than downtown San Jose (for better or for worse). Public transit runs nearby. Parking can be a pain, but the gym does validate for certain garages. Your other option is to park a few blocks away toward Reed in free street parking and walk over.All in all, this gym has been my favorite \"home\" gym.", "date": "1/3/2015"}

Then again other kids turn and they choose another part of wall to climb (no one ask us if the new spot will also work for us). The little girl goes up and stays up (again) for more then 20 min. (the green shirt chats with her mom and her friend dad all the time). Obviously the girl is not only a bit bigger but not a novice, nevertheless it does not look fair. I had kept checking with the green shirt instructor when the girl will be done but he ignores me completely. Now my 6 years old is off to play on my phone. I get tired of waiting, and head to check in. After hearing my story the lady said that no money will be returned since my son got ONE short go. She offers extending the hour. 6 years old not interested anymore. Finally I suggest pass for another time. I also state that if they take $20 for an hour for up to 5 kids, it must be split equally between participants. I am not paying for other kids to hang out with the instructor for 50 min while my child gets one couple of minutes go. After many minutes at the front I go back inside and the same girl is still hanging up (at least 15 minutes of time I was in the front dealing with them not giving equal time). After we are getting ready to leave the green shirt instructor shows up to ask if we now want to have a turn. Declined.I would strongly suggest that if the venue offers semi private instruction, they would be fair to all and say: all gets equal time x min up and down, you make it to the top or not, you need to rest or not, you are done and next participant takes turn. No preferences. And give the children instruction before hand if needed. And ask if they know what/how to do it. Not sure if/when we will use their come again for another hour but very disappointed about the experience.", "date": "11/11/2014"}

After breakfast we came back to my house located not far from The Studio.Since they had time to spare my niece mentioned she'd like to go rock climbing and I promptly suggested your facility.When they arrived at your business my brother asked for the restroom as one customer service representative explained the services provided to my niece. The young lady pointed out the restrooms, but my brother was stopped by another woman who explained that the facilities were available to members only.My brother asked the woman, \"How am I to become a member when you won't even allow me to use the restroom\". He was upset and said, \"this is b.s.\" Perhaps he should have used a better phrase to express his dissatisfaction with your customer service, but in the end he is right.As a customer service representative (I think it was possibly the owner, Diane?) you \u00a0should have been able to discern between a person who is genuinely interested in your establishment and who is there simply to use your restroom.I live downtown and I pride myself on being a supporter of local business. I am disappointed to hear that the woman who refused to allow my brother to use the restroom as his daughter learned more about your services didn't think first or recognize a potential customer. I will never visit or recommend your business again.", "date": "7/2/2013"}
