Here's what I like and don't like about the gym...Like:1) AMPLE parking. The area where this gym is located was planned to have many more businesses than it does, so there is a ton of parking. The lot might get more crowded as more businesses move in, but for now, there is no problem finding a space at any time of the day, something I can't say for any other Touchstone gym I've been to.2) Large weight room. Despite being a smaller gym than Cliffs of Id, Metalmark has a much larger weight area, including a squat rack with a large selection of bumper plates, a few plyo boxes, free weights, kettlebells, all sorts of different exercise balls (including wallballs), and a few machines. There are also rowers, stair steppers, and treadmills.3) Ample classes. There's no CrossFit, but there *are* a ton of classes throughout the day.4) Large, clean locker rooms. Lots of showers, and more than enough lockers (I'm pretty sure they could be at capacity and everyone could still have their own locker).5) Medium sized climbing and bouldering area. Dislike: 1) As I said above, no CrossFit.2) Snack selections aren't as good as some of the other touchstone gyms.All in all, this is one of the better gyms in Fresno for overall fitness, and the perk of being able to go to their locations in the Bay Area and SoCal add a lot of value if you travel frequently.", "date": "12/6/2016"}

I'm not someone who thinks we are all going to hell because an increasing number of people are overweight, but it's great when we can get out and be physical doing something that's actually fun, and this is a great place to do it. There is a gym with workout equipment, a small bouldering area, some miscellaneous things like rings, a climbing rope, and then there are quite a few big climbs for which you'll need someone to belay. The overall vibe here is very relaxed and I like that. If it were closer to my house this is probably where I would work out. They always have coffee brewing and mugs you can use. The employees/instructors are all really friendly. And rock climbing is just tons of fun when it's not real so there's no threat of imminent death. A day pass for a kid is $14 and to rent a harness is $2 each. If you want to wear the most uncomfortable shoes on the planet you can rent them for $4. We opted to just use the shoes we were wearing. My kids had a blast. I would belay one and the other would play in the bouldering area while they waited for their turn. \u00a0It was a great workout for my kids and they had so much fun doing it. We went for a few hours until the kids wore out. Then we went to Me n Eds Victory Grill for lunch, and then back for more rock climbing until everyone's hands finally gave out.

The gym is spacious and well kept, the staff are excellent, and there's so many cool perks make the pricey initiation and monthly membership fees worth every dollar.Now before you consider joining, it's handy to know that you're in for quite a few startup fees. First off, there's a $100 initiation fee for new members, but if you come with the person that referred you, or if you're a student, that fee is cut in half, so it's not way too bad. Then there's the first month payment for your membership, which is $55/mo. normally, and $45/mo. if you're a student. Those are the basic startup costs, and then for gear, it's up to you to see if you'd rather buy or rent. Renting is only about five dollars per visit if you rent both shoes and a harness, though I'd recommend buying, since it'll save you a lot if you're consistent with your climbing. Now the main drawback to buying your gear at the gym is the fact that they don't have a return policy, which is kind've lame, so I'd recommend going to REI in RiverPark (quite a few of the staff at REI happen to be rock climbers who are also members of MetalMark, so there's a major plus). Buying your gear will cost anywhere between $60-$150 for shoes (depending on what kind've shoes you get), around $80 for the harness, and $15-$20 for a chalk bag, plus $2 for a block of chalk (you can just buy your chalk at the gym).It's up to you to decide if all of that is worth the hefty startup investment. To me, it seriously was. I just bought all of my gear right when I started up and it was worth every penny. The members here are the most friendly people you'll find in the city of Fresno who are so encouraging and will help you to achieve your fitness goals and improve your climbing technique, the staff are very knowledgeable, they have all kinds of classes that are free for members such as yoga classes, fitness classes, climbing classes, 6am climbing boot camp (if 6am and boot camp are your jam), the climbing workout and climbing equipment are well maintained, and I just need to mention one more time, the members of this gym are seriously the best people you will find in the entire city of Fresno. I am not kidding. You will meet all of your new best friends if you come here regularly.I have no idea how to describe it, but this gym has an uncanny ability to create such a friendly and encouraging atmosphere between all kinds of people. Everybody is so laid back, and cool to talk to. You can just walk up to anybody to ask about anything and forge an instant friendship within just a few minutes. You won't find this level of friendliness anywhere else in Fresno.Anyways, I hope this review was helpful. I've been here for a fairly long time and it has been worth every dollar I've spent here.", "date": "9/14/2016"}

I have been climbing there for a couple of years now and have a good feel for the place:Positives:-Route turnaround is very fast-Not too crowded-Good mixture of route styles: face, stemming,overhangs, cracks-For the most part friendly and helpful staff-Exercise equipment and fitness classes come with membership-Not my cup of tea, but lots of social events: partner finder, BBQ, etc. -Opens early and closes late.Negatives:-Occasional unprofessional behaviour from some staff, i.e. sleeping on the couch, walking around without a shirt, hanging out with friends, loud and disruptive, playing inappropriate music (gagster rap-swearing, - kids in the gym!)-Grades are hyper-inflated. A 5.11a at metalmark is a 5.10a/b in reality, 5.12a more like a 5.11a/b. -Slackline, cratestacking and acro yoga can get in the way of people climbing.", "date": "12/1/2015"}

I've been a climber for about 6 years, and I needed a place in town to pull on plastic and stay strong. As far as commercial climbing gyms go, MetalMark is really good. The routes change frequently enough that you don't feel as though you're just climbing the same thing over and over, but they also stay up long enough that you can work your sick gym project for a few weeks. I really like the fitness options on the side, the weight area, and the general atmosphere in the gym. It's laid back and friendly. The couch, magazine selection, and free coffee encourage you to hang out and spend the day. The one thing I wish they had is auto belays so that you could come work on longer stuff as an individual rather than just boulder. Also realize that the route grades are absurdly inflated. Most gyms will inflate by a grade or two to make you feel good about yourself, but MetalMark's grades are so ridiculously inflated that I don't even know what to expect myself to climb when I get out to the crag. There's just no basis for comparison. All in all, though, this really is one of the better commercial gyms I've climbed at. It doesn't have the circus-like constant birthday party atmosphere of some, and it isn't a constant parade of blowhards constantly trying to establish a pecking order. It's a great, laid-back place to work out and meet other climbers in town.", "date": "8/26/2013"}
