She was patient and took the time to go over all the proper safety steps with me until i was confident enough to belay with a partner. She was the best teacher I've probably has since the good ol school days. You can tell she loves her job as well as the love for the sport. The facility inside is tight but nicely outfitted with a variety of walls for every skill level. And it's also great for kids and offers an upstairs where one can plan out a climb party. They have different types of memberships for the ones that just can't get enough. The restrooms are kept and the staff members are helpful and informative.

I've climbed elsewhere previously, so this review is flavored by comparisons to my other experiences in the Bay Area/central Oregon.Firstly, this pricing is legit. I don't think I can get a $35/mo membership, or a $300/year membership on Groupon, anywhere else I've ever been. For that price you can go to any of the Hangars, which are all a lil' different. But I'll focus here on Upland.There is a solid amount of bouldering and lead set-ups at this location. Two new auto-belays. Limited options for top-rope, but enough for new folks to shimmy on up. The routes can be really cool/brain teasey, even if the grading seems, to me, sporadic and stiff (but I'd probably take that last bit with a grain of salt, since I'm a pretty casual climber who has plateau'd at V3s. Sometimes I can climb V4s here. Sometimes I can't get up their V2s. It was frustrating at first, but after a while, it bothered me less, and I'll just try whatever). Staff have generally always been nice to me, but are maybe kinda hands off, so if you need 'em, holler. It's not my favorite gym in the world, and not the most aesthetic or clean gym. No bells and whistles. No AC either, for that matter, but there's fans... And lots of chalk (; Just skimming other reviews here and thought to say, for first timers - if you're worried about falling badly/don't yet trust yourself to fall well, I'd consider trying top-roping first instead of bouldering.", "date": "7/17/2018"}

Terrible experience with using Groupons, their waiver system, and the workers there.We had 2 groupons for \"2 intro to rock climbing classes\". We came in 1.25 hours before closing but they said that they don't give out lessons after a certain time. NO WHERE DOES IS THAT MENTIONED ON THE GROUPON. I already drove 45 mins to get here so I don't want to come back another day, plus I was leaving for college the next day and won't be able to use the Groupons before they expire. The worker gave us the option of bouldering so we did that. I've done the rock climbing class at Riverside but my brother, cousin, and friend haven't. My brother and cousin have been to this Upland location before for bouldering so their waiver was already in the system. However it took the front desk 10 mins to pull up my waiver from Riverside, they had to call the Riverside location to finally confirm it. This was my friends first time at a Hangar 18 location so he had to fill out a new waiver. After submitting it, he had to wait for a confirmation email but it never came in so they had him fill out the waiver again. Waited more, still no confirmation email, so he had to fill out the waiver another time! Finally got this waiver confirmed AFTER THREE ATTEMPTS and 35 MINUTES OF WAITING.After confirming the waiver we only had around 40 mins left to do stuff. None of the workers even bothered to explain how bouldering works or safety precautions. My friend who has never done bouldering before was completely lost and I had to explain to him what to do.The Groupon states all gear is provided, but I guess that is only rock climbing gear. When I went to the front desk for chalk, they said it isn't included. You would think since we weren't rock climbing(so already not using any of their material) and with our time they wasted waiting for the waiver system, they could at least lend us some chalk, but nope. No compensation at all.I'm writing this review really late because I tried contacting them about my poor experience, to see if they could do anything about it.

This is the perfect place to get all that, and a full-body workout without actually going to the gym. The place is spacious enough to accommodate large groups of people with room left over, and the climbs themselves are suited for people of all levels; though, beginners will have a tough time the first few tries. It won't take long for you to realize that as easy as it looks from the ground, you will need to train your body to move in ways it's not used to and use muscles that you didn't even knew you had to keep your hold/ balance on these walls. The cool part is that they have both free climbs, where you're not strapped into anything, as well as harness climbs that will take you all the way to the ceiling- in the safest way possible, of course. It's perfect for people who need a bit of a rush in their lives.The memberships start off pretty affordable, but get more and more expensive as the months go along. I guess they're confident enough in the addictive nature of rock climbing that they know you'll want to pay upwards of $30 a month just to keep a membership there. If you live nearby, however, and you happen to hate the gym or working out normally, you're in luck. When you're a member, you can go every day, and stay as long as your heart desires/ your hands and body hold out.For newbies, I highly recommend finding someone who has a membership and using one of their free monthly guest passes to scope the place out before you sign up yourself. I also recommend buying a cheap bag of chalk powder at your nearest sporting goods store as your hands will be feeling the burn after the first few climbs. If you decide this is your new home away from home, you may also want to invest in some rock climbing shoes of your own, as renting them here will cost you $3 a pop, and may or may not make your feet smell really badly.

Yea, you heard me. I have done some cool climbs outdoors, but most of the last 9 years have been spent inside a comfortable gym with an average approach of 50 feet from car to wall. So just trust me when I say that I have been to a ton of different climbing gyms. Hangar 18 in Upland is... \"special\". Let's start with the facility. It's an old airplane hangar. Cute. That doesn't sound so bad right? I'm pretty sure if you left a small child alone in there, they would develop lead poisoning. Don't worry though. The lack of air conditioning or basic insulation will ensure they die of heat stroke first. Also, don't go with an open wound. The polished holds will most likely give you a staph infection after you're done flailing on that V2+. Did I say \"sandbagged\"? Sorry I meant \"cemented\". It took me 3 months to discover that they actually vacuum the floor. I just assumed that the clumps of hair on the ground paid rent, along with the dirt and loose chalk. Do you like to climb during the hours of 3pm to 9pm? You're in luck! There will only be 200 people there when you show up. Smelly elbow room and nowhere to put your stuff is cool right?In addition, this gym is on a long list of places that bans the use of the ATC.

My manager said it was a cool place but I read a lot of reviews stating poor customer service and the staff being rude. I'm also completely new to bouldering and know very little about it (sorry if I fudge up the terminology or am wrong about something)I don't know if other reviewers have their panties in a bunch or if I just lucked out on who helped me, but I had a pleasant experience, almost exactly how I would want to be treated. (Unless you ask questions or look like you're having issues, they leave you alone to fill out the forms [2 forms for adults], give succinct explanations of the rules and how it works there, and give you free rein after you pay)The cost for a day pass is $18 while monthly membership is $36, so membership is definitely something to consider. I'm still on the fence since this is close to work not home, which means I have to bring another set of clothes each time and would only come here after work. (They have multiple locations but none near my house, closest would be a 30min drive)Shoe rentals are $3. They were really helpful and nice about shoes. They explained that they will be very snug fits for usage purposes but if they were too uncomfortable, I could switch them at anytime. I did have to switch sizes after 2 climbs because they were too tight. I didn't experience anything rude, condescending, removed, or anything negative in general from my interactions, questions, and request.TL;DR customer service is good.The facility itself looks alright, a bit smaller than what I thought it would be. There are very bouncy floors for the bouldering areas which made me feel safe in case I fell. Place doesn't look dirty, it doesn't look pristine clean, but that's what I'm expecting when you have tons of sweaty people with their hands covered in chalk. A wide range in difficulty available and it's at most a small wait to climb the wall you want.So why not 5 stars?1 star is docked for a few nit picky details and what I felt was lacking.What was lacking: More beginner routes, maybe separate them as well so it's easier for new people to navigate. There's a limitation on space so not everyone can be catered to, but I think there should be one easy incline wall for newbies to start on. Lockers would be cool. There are cubbies under the benches for you to put your stuff. I don't think people will go through/swipe your stuff; but you just feel more secure with your stuff locked away. Nit picky: A/C would be nice. Didn't need it the evening I went since it was cool enough. I imagine it would be uncomfortable in a hot summer afternoon Fans they're using look nasty. I get they're hard to reach and maintain, but the dust build up on them is pretty significant. I don't particularly care other than for aesthetics since I have no health issues, but I imagine some people would find it concerning.Bottom line: Good place, especially if you opt for membership. This is a gritty place as the sport itself is tough, so don't go in expecting a luxurious comfy upscale setting and service. The employees are just regular people being themselves. I wouldn't recommend going on your own if you're not in the best of shape since you'll be on your own and even the beginner bouldering walls can be challenging. The rope climb/belay has that perk of whoever is helping you, could probably assist you in addition to keeping you safe. I haven't tried this, but my first time rock climbing, my partner would step back to help pull me up on parts I struggled on.", "date": "10/20/2017"}

However, any skepticism of the place is negated once you step inside - it is actually v pretty with all the colored rocks. The place in itself is not meant to handle huge amounts of crowds, so avoid morning hours especially during breaks. Around 1pm, it started dying down and theres no wait time to climb any of the levels.Experience:With our package, they offered lessons which is definitely needed. Lessons happen at the hourly (11am, 12pm, etc) so be cautious of the time you arrive. 1. Come in, sign your life away with liability forms and orientation checklist. Receive harness + shoes. 2. Wait til hourly lesson. They teach you the four checks and basics of knotting and safety of coming down. Our instructor Isaac was super helpful and patient. Warning: This is a partnered activity and you will need a second person to pull the rope as you climb.3. After a bit practice with the instructor, you are free to climb anything you want for as long as you want. There's many different levels but unless you are a natural with much upper body strength, the kid ones are where its at.

The boyfriend and I are frequent climbers at the Long Beach location (like at least 3x a week) but we were up in Rancho Cucamonga to do our taxes and our gear was in the gear, so hey, why not? The location is pretty well-hidden, tucked down a small street in a large warehouse. I really liked the atmosphere there on a Tuesday afternoon. No stinky smells, beautiful natural light coming in through the big windows. Just a nice peaceful vibe for a bouldering session.The bouldering is varied and extensive here, with a couple topout sections where you can climb onto the second floor and take the stairs down. I hope they're working on a gym section or something cool here because it's great space that's not utilized right now. The V1s don't seem to have as much of a learning curve as the Long Beach location, which I liked a lot.Top-rope seemed to be fairly varied, too, and they have a crack! I'm a little new at crack climbing but it seems so challenging and hard that I really wish Long Beach's top-rope section had a crack so I could practice. Overall, if I had a free day, I'd totally drive all the way out to check it out again. Great spot!", "date": "2/29/2016"}

I showed up after my friend Kristi had told me about this place and had urged me to go. I don't normally do things like this but fortune favors the bold and it was the Year of Will. When I got here, it was a little intimidating. I was there on a day pass and there were quite a few veterans already there. There's huge walls with an alphabet soup of colors and shapes on them. Mason was there to get me all signed up, get me all set with the shoes, and the basics. Mason also taught us how to properly belay using the GriGri. I actually had a lot of fun that day and before leaving I decided to go all in and sign up for a membership. I probably would not have had done so if Mason was not as helpful or as accommodating as he was. The staff here is amazing. They aren't passive and you can tell that they are actively passionate and excited about getting people to climb and teaching people how to be become better climbers. I get it. You can climb a rock anywhere. For free (outside). But its the staff here and keep me coming back for more. Alyse, who works with Mason, is one of the sweetest girls you'll ever meet. She's got the brains, the beauty, and the brawns and she is truly passionate about helping you conquer that tough bouldering problem or about talking you through the crux on that tough top-rope route you've been stuck on. The people here are truly rock people; they aren't some high school kids looking to make some cheese on a part time job. They foster the development of the rock climbing community and they'll constantly push you and encourage you to be a better climber. Honestly, I owe Hangar 18--and by extension, Mason, Alyse, and the crew-- a huge thank you. They've turned a one-off field trip into a full on obsession.", "date": "9/18/2014"}

If it is nearby, it's an okay place to go if you want to climb but here are some things to keep in mind:1. Day passes are now $18 (up from $15). this likely has to do with the fact that Sender One just went up from $22 to $24, but honestly given the size and variety, if Upland is going to be $18, I'd recommend just going to Sender One (especially if you have to drive far to get to Upland).2. The staff are generally not that polite and not that helpful...we spent a fair bit of time at the beginning just trying to get everything done that needed to happen to be able to climb and mostly were ignored as the staff were chatting--about non-work topics--with each other. This also resulted one of the staff members being somewhat lax about safety checks...it was okay because everyone in our party was experienced, but wow. Especially when the excuse was that the person didn't have time...he might if he spent less time chilling with colleagues.3. The routes, as with most gyms in the area, are rated in a rather inflated way. That's not really an issue, but do keep in mind that both the top rope and boulder ratings were very inconsistent and seemed to depend more on who had set them, not some kind of consensus. Additionally, very poor use of the gym space...of the non-bouldering area, at least 2/3 of the wall space was lead climbing only...if there was a high demand for lead climbing that would make sense, but nobody was lead climbing while many people were wanting to top rope. There were a lot of great looking routes on the lead wall, too, that would be great top ropes.But hey, if the gym is close or you already have a hangar 18 membership, I guess it's alright. Next time I'm visiting a gym that I'm not a member of, it will be Sender One.", "date": "5/20/2017"}

Though I appreciate that the worker told us that climbers are known to be very honest people...I also grew up in the real world. Glad to say our shoes weren't stolen (thanks honest climbers!), but I'd like the added security of a locker. I feel like Hangar 18 has the bare bones for bouldering. Perhaps if I wasn't a novice climber, this place would seem better. But I was very limited in my routes due to my comfort level remaining around the V0-V1s (not their fault of course). But I didn't get much climbing time in because there were so many other people who wanted to climb those routes too. I also didn't like that there's no topping out.

They also provide climber ' tape and powder to help you get through the climb. It made my rock climbing experience fun.The bad: There is a lack of climate control at this gym. If it's cold or hot outside, it's gonna be the same temperature inside. Another bad note is that the service is bad here. The only thing they're good for is getting rental shoes for you. From a guest perspective it only seems like two people are operating the gym. One is usually at the the desk and the other seems to just pass time climbing around the gym not really working. \u00a0The person at the desk seems to be also the one to teach the lessons with the ropes. \u00a0Every time I bring someone new, they always put me in for the later time. They teach it every 30 mins. While I was waiting I just saw the desk person chatting away with a friend and the other worker was walking around. So I wasted time just looking at them talk. The lesson only takes 15 mins. More about the bad service at this gym...i signed up at the gym in Rancho Cucamunga with three people under my name. I tried to cancel my membership at the upland location, but I couldn't cancel the membership because the worker (ELISA OR ALISA) could access it on her computer. She didn't want to help me out and told me to go to the gym in Rancho. I had to take it into my own effort to call the person in Rancho and deal with them because of the lack of service. The Rancho worker straightened everything out. When I tried to have the Upland worker talk to the Rancho worker on my cell's speaker phone she gave me a disgusted look and just called them on their work phone.

It's in a residential / warehouse area? Though a bit secluded/quiet, I didn't feel sketched out. Plenty of parking! There's an independent storage that sells random antique/second hand stuff literally next door as well to check out. Also conveniently within walking distance of downtown upland for more small random antique shops/ coffee/ food!STAFF / CROWD: Everyone was actually really nice, welcoming, and courteous. I've never climbed before and both the new and old members always offered help whether it was with putting a rope on a specific climbing route or with tips for better climbing. MEMBERSHIP: I believe it like costs $53 for a month of membership. It offers free fitness classes and you can go as many time as you like within the month as well as for a free belaying class (to teach you how to use the harnesses and ropes when with a partner). It costs \u00a0$5 to rent a harness and shoes each visit. They also offer membership discounts through renewal promos, Black Friday sales, and holiday sales! Personally, my friends and I snagged a groupon promo, which was like $53 for two people for one month- entailing 1 free belaying class, free fitness classes, and 1 free guest pass at any of their locations! Their promos are pretty affordable/awesome!ROCK CLIMBING: Apparently they change up the climbing paths on the wall every week which was pretty sweet! The facility is a huge warehouse so it's pretty spacious and bright from natural sunlight coming through the ceiling. I've only been a member throughout December, and it's been pretty chilly during each visit, but once you start climbing, it's not as bad! You need a partner to belay you and vice Versa if you want to climb with a harness and ropes. There's also a free climbing section where you just climbing without ropes/harnesses- if go by yourself. There's also an advanced section where you can rope yourself onto the wall as you climb (you learn to rope yourself to the wall through 3 classes for like $40- just ask the staff). All the different climbing routes are labeled differently depending on difficulty level. There's an upstairs section for kids. I'd say rock climbing is an upper body workout... So if you want to get your guns on point for the gunshow, you should probably consider rock climbing :) RECOMMEND TO A FRIEND?: Yes!

Majority of the places in NYC have a $70+ monthly membership, some with activation fees, some with contracts. I go to NYU so I do have access to the NYU climbing gyms, but Hangar 18 makes the NYU gyms look tiny.If you do the student discount, it's $28 a month. I believe you can get a similar deal on Groupon. That's actually a really good price, considering you get gear, shoe rental, plus belay lessons. If you go twice a month, it's basically worth it. The place is huge. There are plenty of bouldering and top rope problems. They change the routes very frequently, which is good so people don't get bored, but if you come after skipping out on a few days, you might find the route you are working on to have disappeared. I think the place has a good mix of problems as well. I'm a beginner, and when I left for NY, I was climbing V1-V1+ and attempting V2's, so to me, there were infinite number of problems left to do. Like I mentioned earlier, they change the route very frequently so there's no way you will run out of problems to do unless you are REALLY good. The climbing environment is pretty friendly too. Besides a few guys here and there who grunt loudly if they can't finish a climb, everyone else is nice. Some of them will even go out of their way to give you tips. The staff is usually friendly, but some of them do appear kind of stuck up, but hey... they are literally climbing pros who are way better than most, if not all of the climbers there. If you end up getting a membership there and want to avoid crowds, weekday mornings are your best bet. Otherwise, the place gets quite crowded, even on weekday nights. In short, I really miss going to Hangar 18.", "date": "9/18/2014"}

We both learned toproping (climbing) procedures and safety rules from Mike who was very patient (we had a few different groups of ppl taking the class at the same time). Though my friend and I both had a couple times where Isaac had to be more stern w/ us for our safety, we didn't end up on his 'bad' side, and he was very congenial in our talk at the end of our time there. Not only are the staff and facilities great, the people who go there are generally nice too. One of the women who participated in the belay lesson w/ her husband and son seemed to already have had climbing experience, and she kindly gave tips while we learned. Others in the bouldering section were generous w/ their tips, chalk, and space (e.g. made sure n00bs like my friend and I got a chance at the parts of the wall that were marked V0 [the easiest]). It was such an enjoyable experience for the both of us!N.B. it was a bit tricky to find since it seemed to be in an abandoned alley next to a strange warehouse that had a 'For Lease' sign, but I just trusted google maps, and it faithfully brought me to the right place.

You do have to trust them with your unbroken bones! Javier in Upland showed us the ropes (literally!) and was a fantastic instructor! He was very informative about belaying & thorough where we felt very comfortable being first-timers. He guided us through the whole process until we felt comfortable and didn't have any more questions, then we were out on our own. I'd return for some more bad ass daytime dates with my buff babe!

To be able to top rope, you have to take a lesson with one of the Hangar 18 employees. You can just jump on the wall for bouldering. This place is great for kids and adults!

BEWARE: This is probably not Hangar 18's fault, BUT be weary of those groupon deals or any online deals. I bought this deal online, \"For $30, you get two 60-minute rock climbing lessons, two full days of climbing after your lessons, and rental equipment (a $60 value).\", but when we arrived, they told us that groupon had worded it wrong and that we only get one full day of climbing, total! We actually only got one (less than 60-minute ) climbing lesson, too. Trickery! They sure know how to get you with those deals, but I'd say it was still worth it. Besides Boomers, this was my first true rock climbing experience. I tested my muscles and made it to the top of everything I set my mind to. I wish the groupon deal was true because I would've definitely wanted to go back to try a more difficult level or get to the top of those mad rocks (walls with no ropes or harnesses used). *Kisses biceps* Nice staff and some impressive looking regulars, inspiring!

She welcomes all levels of yogis. I've been attending the classes for about a month now and I really enjoy it. I'm a beginner to yoga and was a little skeptical at first but Jenny made the transition for easy and relaxing. I mentioned to her that I was new so she paid extra attention to me on my first day; making sure my postures were correct so I wasn't hurting myself. In fact, as the weeks went on, she did that with a lot of the newcomers. Just mention that it's your first class and she'll adjust your body if needed. The classes are not advanced (I would think you'd need to go to an actual yoga studio for those), but some of the poses can be challenging. It's 1 hr and 10 mins long (usually)...the last 5 mins are spent lying in corpse pose. I appreciate this since corpse pose only requires you to lie flat on your back and wind down from the workout so it doesn't eat into the hour doing more challenging poses.Yoga mats are provided for you but I would HIGHLY recommend bringing your own. The mats they have are very run down and very dirty. I can't imagine doing child's pose on one of those. Yuck. One more thing - if you're looking for a quiet yoga session, this is the wrong place for you. The yoga takes place upstairs, out in the open. So there's a lot of background noises from the climbers. I'm not looking for a serious yoga practice but as an addition to the climbing membership, it's definitely worth it.", "date": "10/25/2015"}

There is also an upstairs for the younger bunch. \u00a0I don't boulder, so I've only tried the v0, which were fun. \u00a0They rent shoes and harnesses and will also give a belay lesson (at an extra charge) to those who are new to climbing. They use a grigri for belaying. The climbing routes vary from the low 5's to probably a 5.12 or so. I typically climb the 5.7- 5.9 range here. The climbs are definitely pumpy and require some dyno moves. \u00a0There are some climbs that have an overhang, which are always fun to try and problem solve. The good thing about indoor climbing is that I don't have to worry about injuring myself on a fall, provided that my belayer is paying attention, of course. \u00a0Also, if there is a route you want to try, but it's not set up, you can always ask the front desk person to set it up for you and they'll find someone who'll do that for you.I recommend this place to those of you who want to try climbing for the first time and need to learn the basics such as the commands and how to belay. \u00a0Although, I do have to admit that I don't belay the way they taught and I don't use a grigri either.

Tip: wear comfortable clothing. have short nails. bring a hair tie if your a girl. wear clothes you don't mind getting dirty because you'll have chalk all over the place. don't wear glasses and put your contacts on! wear socks!restrooms: there is a small locker. no paper towels only dryers. \u00a0they sell cold drinks i.e. gatorade for $2 each. there's a few big fans around. there's an upstairs and a downstairs. upstairs is a smaller area. i had fun. definitely a great new experience. i say try it! it won't be something i'll want to do all of the time but maybe once in a while!expect to be sore the next day and possibly a bruise or two because i have one on my knee. happy climbing folks!", "date": "10/16/2011"}

The facility is basic. Lots of good bouldering areas. But we felt (compared to some other places we went to) it wasn't geared for us, not complete beginners but not advanced. We got their at 10:30, and were signed in and harnessed by 10:40. It then took until 12:10 to actually start climbing!!!!! The guy at the desk made it seem like we could get through the class quick, but the class didn't start for 30 minutes and then it was 2 additional pairs of people to us. The instructor, nice guy and just trying to make sure people are safe, was taking fooooorrreeeevvver. And a couple of times made my bro and I wait for no reason. Like I would ask if we could climb and he would say wait, while he finished with some other people. Really the most frustrating moment was when we asked if we could keep climbing and he made us wait 3 minutes, just to point at us and another group and say we were good to go. Come'on man, 3 more wasted minutes. It was pretty frustrating. We were on a schedule and didn't have 1.6 hours to waste just on getting set up. Once through the climbs were okay. It might not be fair because we had just been to an awesome setup in Norcal.Hangar 18, I know you're a little smaller, but what really would boost the place would be some extra things to do like balance beams or roll boards, simple and don't take up room but really add an extra dimension.", "date": "12/27/2014"}

This was rathering upsetting considering I drove all the way to upland, hoping to use the deal since it was about to expire and that day was the best day to go. But hey, what can I do. We ended up finding time to come again before the expiration date.Tips:- I don't think they provide chalk for you to climb... I believe you have to purchase a bag & I'm not sure how much it costs for a bag- Not that much parking, it's sort of in those lot parking with a lot of gravel / unpaved roads (& it's right next to a residential area)- We got the groupon deal for $15 including the 1 hour lesson & shoe rental, etc. (yes, they give you shoes to wear to climb, you can't wear your own regular sneakers!)- The lesson was exactly an hour & he covered all the safety issues, tying ropes, climbing, helping the other person come down, etc. The instructor was very informative and knew everything there is to know about rock climbing. He was very trust worthy & nice!- There is a bouldering area as well where you just climb yourself up there but you don't need any ropes to assist.- They have big fans around the place so it doesn't get too stuffy / hot inside so that's always a plus- There's also an upstairs rock climbing area but it's small and I believe it's for beginners / kids since it doesn't go that high up lolAll in all, it was a great time!! I dont' think I will go back anytime soon just because I don't have upper body strength and it only takes a couple of steps for me to get tired lol fail.", "date": "6/18/2013"}

It completely eliminates any awkwardness because then once you get there, you just strap yourself on a harness and climb on! However, when I first got there, there was a huge line. It was super crowded on a Wednesday night. It seemed to have a lot of college students. Their monthly membership is only $28/month if you are a teacher or student. Sa-weeeet! But I paid $21 including the rental fee for the harness and the shoes. (My vibrams wouldn't have worked here...) Then, they have these \"bouldering\" walls. Me personally, I couldn't get a good grip but I saw others that were just climbing like Spiderman. THEN, they have the giant walls where you strap yourself onto the harness. It helps to go with someone who is a well-informed climber because if it gets crowded, they may not be able to give you a good tutorial (and trust me, when you are that high up...you want to know what you are doing!) So then, I go to my wall, everything is marked 5.something and the second number varies in difficulty. I was definitely looking for 5.1 and the lowest I saw was 5.5. Deal! I'll take it. You then follow your respective colors and climb on! BUT if I were following \"yellow\", not gonna lie, I cheated and had to step on blue or purple a couple of times. Here's where it gets CRAAAZY! I was on top of the wall and feeling awesome that I conquered it (and while doing so, I had to have complete trust in my belayer-person) BUT THEN, I hear someone fall! I tried to calmly come down, and then once I got down, I freeeaaked out! Holy Mack! Someone FELL! But the staff reacted VERY well! They immediately called the ambulance and the person was going to be okay. There are a lot of mats that give the climber confidence. But for my first time rock climbing, the last thing I want to hear is someone falling while I am 50 feet high....(I'm not sure how high the walls are but it sure felt high!)

(\"Climb-it holds\")-all ages can do it (depending on general fitness)- the youngest I saw was 2 years old (got half-way up the wall) the oldest was probably in his 70's-this pro is more for the ladies: as a result of the no shirt required, and the nature of climbing, there are almost always a couple of topless dudes with super-cut muscles climbing around (regular climbers) that- and some not-so-cut, hairy dudes too- haha-They offer classes for introduction to climbing (how to climb) including belay, rappel, lead climbing, etc. \u00a0they also do guided outdoor tours (ask Dave)-color coded routes: some gyms use colored tape, I find it easier to follow the colored holds, than it is to look for tape that falls off sometimes.-theres more pros, but you'll find out when you go here!

(I really can't get over how sad I am that I no longer live close to Hangar 18!)Parking is free, restrooms and snacks for purchase on site. Climbing includes free shoe/harness rental. (yes, free!) And there are student discounts.", "date": "2/9/2009"}

It wasnt crowded at all. We signed the waivers and got our shoes and harness. It was funny because on the waiver it said basically if i hit the floor they werent responsible lol. but i guess i didnt think about bouldering. It was a pretty big facility though like i said i havent been to one before. There are some small walls to begin on if your a beginner upstairs, then theres quite a bit of walls on the main floor to climb all varying in difficulty. There is also a bouldering area. My belayer i had for the duration of my climbs was very informative, helpful, and easy to communicate with, some other belayers just spotted you and didnt say a word. So the belayer i had made it much more enjoyable and he also let me use his hand powder which helps a lot. Everyone that was there was very friendly and i met a lot of different people. Our time was up at 12:30pm but it started getting quite crowded. The total for the group of 14 was 270 dollars minus the 50 dollars we had to deposit. I feel like we got ripped off because my belayer said day passes were 16 dollars. Overall i had a good experience and will definitely consider going back. Especially since its a fun way to work out. I definitely recommend this place to others, cuz i was told it is better than the other areas around this region. Also enjoy the soreness in your forearms!", "date": "4/18/2010"}
