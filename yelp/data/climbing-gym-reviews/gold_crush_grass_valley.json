(Where you stick your hand in a crack, cup your hands, and then climb from there).They mostly do free climbing, but they have certain times throughout the day when they bring out the harnesses for people to use.The prices are about $15 for admission and shoes, or $10 admission without shoes.", "date": "1/18/2019"}
