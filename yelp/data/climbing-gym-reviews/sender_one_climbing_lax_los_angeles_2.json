There's a huge, spacious area for belaying and bouldering* which is kept pretty clean. Shoe rentals aren't bad either. Dropped it one star because it's a bit pricey and the whole facility smells like feet when you walk in, but the intro offer is good (basically comes out to like $10 a session or so), so definitely try it out!

Although I may have found a new hobby. Took the hour session Intro to climbing class. I would recommend everyone do so before starting out on the floor. I thought I could get away without taking this beginning class. Like how hard could it be to climb, but no, spend the money. They sometimes have a Groupon if you're tight on cash. The instructor will show you how to properly tie an 8/ fishermen's knot, how to belay and other tips you will need to be safe while climbing. These are all life saving safety precautions, so please don't try to skip this session. After, the hour beginning session, they will allow you to climb with a partner at no time frame. Went with a friend and we took the hour session then stayed 3 hours more to climb. We had so much fun and tried some of the other levels. Other tips, I would suggest to get there 15/20 minutes early, as I went during a busy time, so it took about 5 minutes to find parking. There is parking located all around the building and on the street. You will also need time to sign a waiver and put on climbing shoes that they provided as part of that fee. One more thing, loved the staff and the instructor. All very nice! The instructor was very attentive, upbeat and made sure we properly were retaining the material before he let us climb on our own.

I did see a child trying to put on his own harness clip and he was like 5 years old and some kids just DO not listen when they want to climb they don't know the consequences of not listening to rules. I helped a few kids throughout the party, clipping the rope to their harness safely. There wasn't enough staff to watch the all the kids. Perhaps it would be safer if there were staff at designated walls and they make sure for each kid they actually touch and check the clip before allowing them to climb. The kids are not going to wait around to find an available staff after doing a couple of walls they may feel overly confident and think they can just do it themselves. No no no! They need to wait and get the staff to hook them up!!! But they are little kids! I hope there are no accidents that would be my concern. I know they are doing the best they can but having so many kids running from wall to wall made me a bit nervous. Like I said I think they need staff in their spots in charge of a wall or 2, and check each and every kid themselves. Not even the grownups should really be hooking and unhooking these kids like I did. Other than that this place is really cute, they have a great variety of walls, the kids had a blast and they want to go again! Please keep up the safely and don't make us parents nervous.

The best part is that the surface area for these routes is massive and so you are never in a crowded area.

Plenty of routes for all levels.Training boards:Sender knocks it out of the park with the training boards. You can't even compare Sender to Hangar 18. These are almost always empty too! Can't believe it. Events:They have weekly evening socials so that you can get to know other climbers. They also have classes for lead climbing and bouldering competitions.

The walls are tall, the features are rad, and the amenities are all top notch. The only thing that keeps this from being a five star review is that the grades are incredibly soft. I understand that keeping the stoke high for noobs is important, but it's also misleading to call a 5.9 climb a 5.10c, or even worse, calling a 5.10c climb a 5.12a. As an experienced climber, I know how to translate the Sender grades into what their outdoor equivalents would be, but if I was a new climber pulling 11s in Sender and tried getting on an 11 outside, I would get in trouble. Sometimes getting out of trouble is easy. Sometimes getting out of trouble requires a SAR Team. For perspective, Sender climbs are basically jug fests until you start getting into the 11s. Outside, jug fests go away at around 5.7. So my advice to management is to please start adjusting grades to be more realistic. At every other gym I've ever climbed at, the setter sets the grade and then climbers take a sharpie and either agree to that grade or check a box that goes two grades in either direction.

However due to the complete lack of on the floor supervision from staff there was constantly, at all times, members engaging in dangerous and disruptive behavior the entire 3-4 hours I was climbing. I shall provide a few examples.The least disruptive but by the far the most dangerous thing I witnessed was a couple lead climbing where the belayer had a baby strapped to her back. This lady was lead climbing someone up a 12.c route with a baby on her back in a cloth carrier. Any common lead fall from the climber would have jolted her forward possibly into the wall. Minimum she would be 5-10 feet in the air with a 6month infant unsecured on her back. Worse case she could have slammed into a wall and injured the infant. The fact that no staff saw this and didn't immediately kick them out is outlandish. In addition to this parents seem to let their children run around the gym like a jungle gym unsupervised. The only time I saw a parent actively watching her children was in the upstairs bouldering area. She was watching 5 kids all running around like maniacs and screaming like it was a playground. Making that area pretty much useless to anyone wanting to climb there. In addition she also had a small little dog she was holding. Not a support animal or anything... just a little prissy rich spoiled dog she was holding, not on a leash or anything. That way if anything bad happened she would be useless to helping out any kids cause she had a dog she also needed to hold. Other parents were belaying kids with no certification. By some miracle a staff member seemed to notice and told him to go get his cert to put it on his harness. At that moment his kid was climbing a 25ft wall with NO SAFETY KNOT! \u00a0I guess belaying young children with no training and certification is allowed , because they didn't stop him, didn't make the kid come down. Just told him to go get it when he was done. Spoiler alert... he did not and continued to climb with his misbehaved child (can't blame the child since the father was completely inept and was allowed to act as such per the staff) I don't know how this place has a operating business license. I'm gonna write to the city or someone who deals with such things. This is dangerous. Just full stop dangerous. How are they allowing guest to climb with infants strapped to them!?", "date": "8/19/2018"}

No pretentious stuffiness here. - Quality route setting with tall walls. The second best route setting I've experienced indoors! And they keep everything fresh. Did I mention tall walls?!- Substantial weight training and cardio area. - Clean Showers/locker rooms. I've only been to one Yoga class, it was very pleasant.

I've always had positive encounters with fellow climbers, staff and faculty members. The staff here in particular are so upbeat; you can tell they're really passionate about climbing & thus spread positive energy!Lastly, Sender One hosts awesome, cool events that you MUST check out, such as Sender Nights (you climb with a headlamp; the lights are off) and the Sender Games (Olympic-like competitions, food and beer; how awesome is that!?).

It had been awhile since I had last climbed-- at least 10 years-- so upon entering the MASSIVE gym I was a little nervous since the walls are to the warehouse ceiling (after reading other reviews this is up to 80')! Though the gym is new and still preparing for their grand opening later this month, and it was a Tuesday night, it was filled with climbers bouldering, top rope climbing, and lead climbing. There are even two areas to boulder on the first and second floor-- upstairs, they encourage you to climb all the way over the top before coming down! After a quick tour by Peter, we were fitted in our gear and able to try our hand at climbing. There were many different routes for us to try, each numbered by difficulty and coded with different colored paths. I started with the lowest intensity (pink) and ended up doing 3 different climbs throughout the night. The staff was incredibly friendly, helpful, and encouraging to us beginners, and they belayed us as many times as we wanted throughout the night. I had forgotten how tiring climbing is and how much of an adrenaline rush it is looking down when you're at the top!During the tour, we got to peek at Sender City, an autobelay interactive climbing/activity room for adults and kids alike. After checking out the room (and watching some videos online) I can't wait to come back and try this area out. The gym also offers a cardio/fitness area and yoga classes open to members as well as those who purchase a day pass. It was awesome being able to get out of my comfort zone and try something I would not usually do, but now I will definitely be coming back!", "date": "3/8/2017"}

There was a section that felt like you were climbing past 45 degrees, which was intense and a lot of fun! The lead climbing walls here are also higher than the Santa Ana location, needing a 50m rope to climb.There's also a bunch of walls of varying heights, so if you're tired there is a shorter wall to try on. The routes are much more interesting too, there was one that went completely horizontal, there are more interesting corner routes, and there were routes with like mini-ledges too.

The space itself is so much fun for kids and set up in a way that is completely DIY. (No need for certified spotters for the little ones - any parent or older sibling could clip on the kids). It's a beautiful, clean and modern space.I'm docking 1 star for the following: We paid for a Party Attendant who showed up late and, due to miscommunication, did not have our designated decor items. They had apparently left the Ninja decor set in their Santa Ana location. The attendant spent the first hour decorating the space, which means that there's really no one around to help guide the kids as to what to do. Our kids were roaming around the facility until someone told them they weren't allowed to. Finally the trainers showed up and started the warm up games.We're told to show up 15 minutes early, but it was clear no one was going to help us until 10 minutes after the start time. We were told that the first 30 minutes was setting up, which seems a little too much time. None of the \"schedule\" of activities was communicated to us prior. We were just told 1 hour climbing and 1 hour eating/cake, etc. But it was 15 minutes set up/harnessing and 15 minutes of warm up \"games\" - then just free climbing for another hour. \u00a0So you really don't need to arrive 15 minutes prior to the start time. So total party time was 2.5 hours vs. 2. During the party, the alternate attendant (our main attendant had by then disappeared) was lovely and helpful but was not experienced with facilitating a party. None of the dishes had serving utensils, and we had to ask for forks for the cake. The main party attendant ended up giving us $130 and 2 free adult passes for not having the decor, so we were pleased overall.But as a former event planner, it was hard for me to see the lack of organization. Despite the mishaps, two of our friends will be booking the space as a result of experiencing our party. I still highly recommend this place, because the kids could care less that the decor was \"super hero\" instead of ninja, and that there were no serving spoons or forks.", "date": "4/26/2017"}

The facility is very clean and spacious and there were enough Sender One people helping the almost 30 climbers. I think they truly understand the necessary adult to climber ratio, which was a big plus, as some of the climbers did need extra assistance. Although I was busy being the host for most of the party, I did notice in the climbing area, the Sender One staff that were there to help, were very friendly and upbeat. Meaning no one was being assertive and forceful (yelling) as some of the climbers did get nervous on the higher climb areas and had trouble getting down.I think one of the great things about having our party here was the communication between myself and staff. In the beginning, I was very worried about having a party in March because it coincided with the soft and grand openings for Sender One. Once it was closer to the party date, I spoke with staff \u00a0quite frequently (sorry, I know I called a lot, but blame it on the type A mom in me) and everything turned out fine on the big day.Our party package included pizza (Fresh Brothers) which was delivered on time and hot (and not sitting for hours). They also allowed me to bring in my own food and had extra tables set up for the food, cake and presents. The only thing to note and I would not take off a star for it, was the fact that I paid extra for a party attendant from Sender One to help with the food and cake. I think this attendant was a bit shy and possibly not used to hosting kid's parties because he was pretty timid and seemed a bit out of his element with the food serving and drinks. Sensing his timidness, my fellow moms stepped in to help and he seemed okay with having things delegated to him rather than taking the initiative. Again, no big deal, he took care of everything else, and maybe he was the only one available that day.My daughter keeps asking when she can go back and so do her friends. There is nothing better than hearing from other moms that their daughter had the best time at our party.Thank you Sender One!", "date": "4/6/2017"}

It is unclear to me what the staff does in the kids area other than strapping them in, and at that, only one staff member and there are no checks and balances to ensure these vulnerable kids and properly equipped. A friends harnass kept moving and turns out it was wrong. Also they play a video saying that staff members will help and yet from when you begin to the end nobody comes in unless you ask for help. There is a two child to one adult ratio but that is really hard given and there is zero staff support. In fact, when I was there almost six staff members were hanging out at the front desk and none seemed to be working. I came by to ask for help and it seemed to be an inconvenience. I don't feel this gyms service is good and for that reason I won't come back to be a member again. Again great facility but serious work on the service side.", "date": "5/2/2018"}
