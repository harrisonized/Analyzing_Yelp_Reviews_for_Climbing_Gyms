There is so much more space and equipment to use and you can easily get in a great workout here. Love the expansion!", "date": "12/1/2018"}

It's more spacious and allows for more room to work out, as well as more classes. I have taken Adrea Reed's Mat Pilates, Rebecca Fink's and Rohaya Esa's Yoga classes, and they have all been thoroughly and enjoyably challenging. I look forward to taking more classes at the yoga center :)", "date": "8/20/2018"}

There's a plethora of classes: Vinyasa, Acro Yoga, Move & Meditate, Yin Yang, Restorative, etc. and I've gone to all. They use Mindbody so it's convenient to see the schedule and reserve your spot. There's also a fitness center next door so it's convenient to get a workout in and then head to yoga to wind down :) I'd check it out if you love to stay active to recalibrate!", "date": "8/17/2018"}
