They do only have one wall that you can top out, but it's quite long with varying routes for both beginners and skilled climbers. It's also pretty sweet to be able to walk down the stairs after a climb.What I loved most about this gym in comparison to other gyms is the auto belay system. Yes, it's quite scary at first, but try not to think too much about it. If it makes you feel better, I had a friend who was up there for 45 minutes and took about 3 gym staff to calmly bring her down. So, I promise, you won't die. There are routine checks for the belay system, so you can breathe now. In terms of crowd, there are quite a lot of people and children on weekends and starts to build around noon-ish because of the intro classes, so try to get there when it opens or earlier in the morning if you can.Parking can get a little bit tricky in the lot, but there are plenty of street parking available if you can't get in. I also started attending the workout classes earlier this year--just the sculpt lab and the full body circuit. They're both challenging and totally worth the pain, sweat, and possible tears, but the instructors are amazing! Many of the peeps that come to the class are climbers themselves and come with a variety of pain and aches, but the instructors are super patient and really work with you through it. I would definitely recommend and hope that they open a few more HIIT-like classes in the near future!**Also, these classes are included in your day pass. Woot Woot! It can't get any better than that!Belay on friends!", "date": "4/6/2019"}

They do have different levels for more experience climbers and they have beginners which is neat. I would definitely come back, It was one hell of an experience. I was sore for about a week.

My family hasn't been in the yoga place so check out another review or go there yourself! There is also a small workout corner for 12 years and above in the climbing gym.

There is a more advance free climb wall that I hardly ever see anyone on and wish half of that could be replaced with more harness climbs or find a spot to install more harness climbs. I dont think there is enough variety in climbing choices and after a couple hours I get a little bored. Also I wish Top Out would bring the pool table back! They still have the foosball table but games such as those allow me to take a break from climbing while waiting for my arms, hands, and feet to relax.

I took my younger brother (13 years of age and he owned it so feel free to bring your sons/daughters/youngins) to a Saturday 1pm class and was very grateful to find that there were only 2 other people in the class. For those who are shy and anti-people, you would want a small class because many times, the groupmates take turns trying a course while the others watch on.You really have to push yourself physically and mentally, even for many of the beginner routes, but the point is to not be discouraged because everybody started somewhere, even the monkey-pro climbers you'll see smiling at you to encourage you.Beware: your hands will hurt like a mother- and you will get calluses on your hands (yes, from one experience). Also, you WILL be sore if this is your first time, regardless of your daily workouts, so plan ahead!", "date": "7/7/2014"}

I've pretty much forgotten everything. When this place opened up I was super excited to have a place that was actually driving distance.My first time here was a little over a week ago. Myself and my friend went and rented the gear and got the day pass. I had never used an auto-belay before and the staff was super helpful in showing me how it all worked and gave us some tips and pointers. And then we were climbing away.I really like the courses they have set up on the belay wall. There's a ton of beginner ones but also some very difficult ones that I'm a long way off from trying. I watched some more advanced climbers do them and they seemed to find them fun and challenging as well. (They have the easy 5.6-5.9's and then a bunch of 10's of all different letters if you're trying to gauge if there's something difficult enough for you)The bouldering area is AMAZING, even if bouldering scares the crap out of me. It takes up probably about 70% of the gym including a top out wall that has stairs in the back to go down. I did it once, on the easiest route I could find, and some how managed not to hyperventilate and die. The staff is very friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. These are people who enjoy working there and love climbing. They made me feel welcomed and taken care of. I lasted about a week before I knew I had to go back and I bought a 10 visit pass. I can only go about once a week with my schedule so the 10 visit made sense for me. If you plan to go twice or more a week you'll want to check out their memberships instead, which are pretty reasonably priced. After climbing again tonight, playing a giant game of jenga in my down time, \u00a0trying my had at the tension line, and meeting other climbers who were just as nice as the staff, I'm hooked. I LOVE this place!(Pro-Tip: The Sunday I went on didn't have many kids around but there was a few very well behaved ones. The Monday evening at about 9:30 pm was entirely made up of adults. They're open until 11 so if you're looking for a good time to go and not deal with kids or crowds, later on a weekday is ideal, try to time it a little after the intro to climbing class is over.)", "date": "10/21/2013"}

Staff are awesome, the regulars are incredibly friendly (often rooting on new climbers or offering words of advice), and their prices on gear or equipment are pretty much spot on with even online pricing. They run specials every month, Ladies Night, College Night, Family Night, etc... As well as running Yoga classes and competition teams. Definitely a fun place for a date or to drag the kids to burn off some energy.", "date": "2/13/2014"}

It seems like a great place actually to have a birthday party. You know, have the kids run around for a little bit, get in them car and get the home they'll knock right out. I also think it's a wonderful place for an adult birthday party.The front desk individuals were really nice. For two shoes and two harnesses it was $12 and our entrance fee was covered by a Groupon we had. We were there for two hours and that's a good amount of time to be there because you're surely tired out. All in all I had a really great time. I can't wait to go back.

New climbers and kids are more than welcomed as there as some easy routes for beginners. For experienced climbers, don't worry; they have many routes from V4 - V10 range as well. The gym has an auto-belay wall with multiple routes on each line. There is a pretty tall topout wall (~25 ft.) that can be a little scary to topout on if you don't feel comfortable at heights. I recommend that wall for more experienced climbers. There is also a backwall with a nice overhang to practice that type of climbing.If your muscles get a little tired, you can take a break and practice on a slackline they set up or at the billiards table they have.To pretty sum it up, they got stuff for anyone looking to climb.", "date": "6/26/2013"}

I love the fact that it's all auto-belay so you're not left out of the top-roping world if you don't have a buddy. I think a staff member should always be supervising (which is not the case) for safety reasons, but I think that's the only downside. The routes are well set and the setters are mostly outdoor climbers. It's a fun spot even if you're not climbing--there is a pool table, a foosball table, giant Jenga, and lots of sitting space for parents happy for a little relaxing break.

For experienced climbers this is a great place to work on techniques and endurance, whether you have a partner or not. As far as being beginner friendly, it has is +'s and -'s, The good: there is no test to pass to use the walls, since they have auto-belay machines, so you can focus endurance and improving your climbing technique... The bad: you don't learn to tie a figure-eight knot or how to belay when using the auto-belay machines. \u00a0But all-in-all if you are a beginner, this is a great place to start if you don't want to spend a ton of money right away, which is usually what most beginners don't want. Once you develop an interest and improve your technique, you will want to go take a class and learn how to tie in and belay, before you ever go outdoors. :)Staff here is friendly and helpful.

All the other members are super open about giving pointers to newcomers.And when your arms are totally pumped and you can't climb anymore, you can always relax and shoot pool or play 2x4 sized Jenga", "date": "7/15/2013"}

Their best selection is in the 5.10-5.11 and V3-V9 range. It's huge and airy and when it's not actually broiling outside (80+) the fans keep it just cool enough to work out (not cold, and not as good as an AC, but you make due). I really love the auto belay (though I do miss the teamwork of real belay) because you can climb by yourself and its less scary for a lot of beginners than trusting a person to hold them up. There is more variety in the free climbs too and I find climbing up and over the top of a ledge much more satisfying. Between routes, I love playing at the fooseball table, the pool table, using the cycling machines or the treadmill, and just chillin on the little couches. It's a great way to take a breather or finish off a trip to the gym. Their store is also super cute with quality gear and supplies.

(kids have to be 3 or older to climb so baby was a spectator only). \u00a0The staff was awesome...friendly, helpful and made us feel right at home! \u00a0We are beginners with almost no climbing experience and had no problems getting right into it! \u00a0The equipment was in great condition, the gym was clean and well designed, there was even a pool table, foosball, & couches for when you need to rest. \u00a0The owner & staff were visible and available to help, but not obtrusive in any way. \u00a0 We stayed for almost 3 hours and my kids said \"Can we come back everyday?\" and \"Make sure you put family night on the calendar so we never miss it!\" \u00a0Even the other gym patrons were amazing...neat community of people! \u00a0My 4 yr. old didn't want to climb very much so he ended up playing Foosball with a few college kids who were sooooooo sweet to him. \u00a0We will definitely be back and hope this place never loses its relaxed and welcoming vibe. \u00a0Thanks for the best Family Date Night so far!!", "date": "9/2/2013"}
