We are so happy we found out about this treasure in our small city. They have so much to offer from beginning level to more advanced rock climbing. \u00a0They have a small weight area that allows use of free weights, squat rack, yoga mats, and so much more. I am so excited to be a member of this facility. My kids love it here too. At first they were scared because there are no harnesses, but they warmed up quickly. They also have thick padding under all the rock wall sections in case you do fall... and people do! The restrooms are super clean. The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable about any questions you may have. I love that the kids get a great workout and don't even realize that they are breaking a sweat because of the fun they are having. There is also a smaller wall with huge building blocks for the smaller kiddos.", "date": "8/4/2018"}

You need to be a member to use the facilities 24/7 and they have limited hours for those who want to check it out and sign up.There is not staff always at the desk so you need to check the schedule so you don't waste a trip. \u00a0They rely on their members to make sure rules are being followed and things are taken care of.Rock climbing is very challenging and I can see why so many find it exhilarating and even addictive. \u00a0You build strength, dexterity, and stamina. \u00a0The climbing routes are rated and color coated.The Pad is \u00a0much needed option for our community, and I'm glad it's here. \u00a0It's a very good size (5,000 sq. ft.) and it's much larger than its older sister in SLO. \u00a0There is a party room for birthdays and it's regularly used for Yoga from what I gather (free for members). \u00a0If you're new at this, they offer free rental shoes so don't hesitate to swing by.", "date": "9/26/2016"}

Huge walls, so much space that you'd be hard pressed to climb more than 1/4 of the routes on a given day, plus easy to get to, tons of parking, nice restrooms, plenty of floor space, great beanbags to relax between routes, and best of all it's super close to Zoe's Hawaiian BBQ (perfect spot for post climb hangout).Don't forget that, with a membership, you also get access to yoga classes at no extra charge, as well as full access to the SLO location....tough to beat a deal like that, IMO!", "date": "8/16/2015"}

This organization is run by an awesome group of people with a lot of integrity. It's where I met most of my friends when I moved to the Central coast. Besides the community, The Pad is a huge upgrade from SLO OP-- 3 times larger, new exercise equipment, free yoga classes, etc, but still with the same high quality and creative route setters. I can't say enough about how fantastic these bouldering gyms are. The location is tucked away in a low traffic area in Santa Maria, but that's why the gym is so expansive and parking is readily available.", "date": "7/31/2015"}
