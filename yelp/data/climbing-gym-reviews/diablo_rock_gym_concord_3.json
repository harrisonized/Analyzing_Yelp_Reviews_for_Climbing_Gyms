Prob is the gym is antiquated and poorly stocked. They dont have the most basic equipment most gyms have..Except in the crossfit area, which costs an additional $20 a month on top of the very high member fee. I can understand paying extra for CLASSES but I can't use the unused space for open gym? How asinine when the reg gym isn't properly stocked. At 24 hr fitness i get all the equipment i need AND classes for half the price. Step it up diablo rock. Here's the issue they don't seem to understand. Crossfit hoards most of the equipment. You can't get realllyyy basic things in the regular gym. Like, a medicine ball/sand ball. We're rationed one. I hope you wanted 10lbs! Want a kettle bell? Well you get exactly 5 to choose from, hope you wanted super light or mega heavy! Want dumbells? Sure! We've got these awkward wide plate ones that are rusting from the 70's! Oh wait, did you want dumb bells lighter than 10lbs? Oh well go dig in that dusty old bucket, im sure youll find one random 8 lb and one 5lb. Hell, sometimes I can't even access the rowing machine because guess what? Crossfit takes that too sometimes! It's fine to say that this isn't a 24hr fitness, sure. But I'm constantly having to improvise my workouts here due to lack of equipment and to see the adequate equipment available but not accessible when membership is already $100+/month is completely uncalled for. They need to either properly stock the reg gym or let paying members access the equipment that, lets be real here, our memberships definitely paid for.", "date": "4/27/2019"}

Keep in mind that it has a very small bouldering area (the smallest of all the Touchstone gyms) and can get quite crowded during peak hours. They also rely on crash mats for climber safety, as opposed to the fat pad flooring that they have at Dogpatch and Ironworks. This can make falling or jumping down a little more hazardous for those used to the other gyms (I know one climber who recently missed the mat when coming down and suffered a slight ankle sprain). If you want to go bouldering, don't be afraid to move the mats around! There are a lot of routes for those looking to top rope.The workout area is pretty spacious and has a pool on site. The weights and machines are a little dated, but often free for those looking to get in a quick workout.

It was our first time at this rock gym. We bought tickets online for the beginners class + day pass package. It came out to be around $30 a person. The last time I had been rock climbing (not here) was about 3 years ago and I remember the class being very informative and slow paced...I mean you could really mess up in this sport so it should be. We started out with the class (this is what brought down the stars): A guy with a cap came over and gave us our harnesses, belay, and carabiner. He then proceeded to show us how to tie everything...super fast like we just needed a refresher. Uh, we are noobs, can you slow down? We were with another couple at the time who were first timers as well and we all had trouble keeping up. He acted very impatient every time we were slightly confused. After asking many questions and getting the same \"you should already know this\" attitude, we finally suited up and were ready to climb. The rest of the trip wasn't that bad. They had many levels from easy to extremely difficult climbs. We tried all the easy to medium ones with the latter being good challenges for us. They also had a tightrope for you to try if you were feeling adventurous, which we were. Although, there are other gyms that are much bigger in comparison, this one was a decent size and you could easily spent 3 hours here.All in all, if we were there to just climb without the lessons, I could go again. I have to just keep practicing in the air with how to tie the ropes so I don't forget and can pass the test. Not having to deal with the people who work there every time would be best. Otherwise, I'd definitely pick somewhere else if you were just starting.", "date": "10/21/2015"}

Had been climbing here since late 2008 and had to cancel and rejoin a couple of times. I will say the 2017 prices seem a little out of control. I was in last week with a friend and noticed the prices that had been posted and the day rate is going from $20 to $25. Seriously a 25% increase in a daily rate, which does not include shoes or any gear. Thankfully I have my own gear otherwise I would be about $30 bucks just to climb for a little while.. Also, the monthly rate seems to go up 2 bucks a year, so I guess that is to be expected. I have always had my gripes with gyms and their initiation fees. Really a $100 for someone to plug in some data entry? Outside of my nickel and diming complaints the gym is very well equipped. More than adequate climbing areas and a solid workout room. Lots of classes and workout styles that are accommodated. In the last almost decade here I have met so many good friends and made so many memories. The service is amazing with super friendly and helpful staff and solid amenities I will keep it a 4 and ding it the one star for the shortsighted pricing policy though.Update:Hans from the gym let me know that the day rate had not changed in like 5 years and that the initiation fee is waived during the month of January.", "date": "1/5/2017"}

I looked at your website & saw good reviews. We are all new to rock climbing and your facility, so we even went to check the gym before booking the party. And that's when I actually first noticed the poor customer service at your front desk. I had questions with the prices and how things worked if I wanted a party. Basically, left your gym that night saying to one of your front desk people: \"Should I just look at your website?\" Because honestly, he made me feel that he did not have time to answer my questions. A few days passed, since my daughter really wanted to rock climb for her Bday, I went ahead & called to book the party over the phone. I had a few questions first, coz again we are new to your facility & are not sure on how things work. Well, this is how it ended..I said: \"You know what, I'll just book the party on line.\" Why? Because as I was trying to ask & talk to this someone on the phone, he was talking to someone else! I almost did not want to book the party there anymore at this point.Today...today was the day of the party. I already had an idea of what may go wrong, but I was hoping it would be different. Unfortunately, it was not. Our party was 4-6pm..I was told we are able to use the party room at this slot even though you don't offer it at this time on Sunday's. I came a little early @ 3:45pm to check in. We were checked in by JP or PJ. I asked if we are able to set up in the party room & he said there's a party that is still there & to check back in about 10 minutes. We check back at 3:55pm & asked someone else if the room was ready...JP or PJ annoyingly shouts \"I already checked them in!\" I had to step away because I did not want to loose it in front of my children and her guests. My husband finally spoke to an older gentleman & we were told that the room is being cleaned, but for the meantime the girls could start climbing. Katie was the girls instructor and if it weren't for her, my daughter's experience would've been really awful. Katie was awesome! (She is the the reason for the 1 star) Thanks to Katie or else it would've gotten really bad. The whole time that the girls were climbing, guess what happened to the party room? No one ever bothered to come up to me or my husband to follow up on it. We had our cooler, snacks & decorations for the room by the sofa waiting. I just told my husband to take everything to the car & forget it! If it weren't for one of your other staff over hearing me complain to my older sister about talking to the manager that someone finally talked to us. This was already probably 5:45pm! JP or PJ came out to apologize to my husband, but for what?! It was already done!!Improve your customer service at your front desk. Teach them just simple common courtesy. Teach them that they can't assume that not every person that walks in your gym is supposed to know what to do! I asked for climbing shoes for one of my daughter's guests & I get a snarky comment that her shoes is as good to use. I know that! She preferred climbing shoes! JP or PJ rolls his eyes and basically drops the shoes like he did not want to give it to us! Ask him if he heard anything from me?! I'm a very patient person, but I could've really lost it there at that point. I'm an adult & your staff are all kids! They are hanging out there in front, flipping their hairs & acting like they can't be bothered! Please.. my daughter loved the experience climbing with Katie. I am really considering signing up so she is able to do more climbing. But if your front desk staff is not going to improve, I'll take my business somewhere else & soon other people would too. For the record, I am not complaining so that we can get free classes or a refund. Ask PJ or JP(whatever his name was!), because he did offer that to my husband.

The parking lot is pretty small, but there's usually spaces available. (Tip; Sky High is around the corner). When you 1st enter, there are leather couches to sit in.

The place itself is pretty small too. There are about 4 rock walls, a gym (for 18 years of age or older NO KIDS ALLOWED, and a bouldering wall section (climbing without harnesses). The rock walls itself are based on levels. The higher the level, the higher it is. New rock climbers should start off on an lower level so they can get more confident.The place is really nice, but it's not that much for me. You see, I'm a tiny bit afraid of heights and I can't climb high so this place doesn't get me a lot of hours of exercise. At the front, there is a counter where you can buy (energy) snacks & soda. I had a cookie there which was ok. The food is on display and sits there, so obviously it's not fresh. \u00a0Next to it is a tiny gift shop wear you can buy gear and stuff. I haven't been in here so I don't know much about the prices and what they sell.:)", "date": "10/26/2012"}

I used this gym for 3 months and it started out being everything I wanted/needed.I would get to the gym at 6:am and all the machines were always available, the atmosphere was relatively quite, the music was good and watching people do the various activities, like rock climbing and cross fit, just added a sense of community to the gym. \u00a0 \u00a0The staff is friendly and over all, things were just fine. \u00a0 I had been thinking about getting my kids to come with me and do some of the rock climbing courses the gym offers. \u00a0 I'm glad we never made it to that point. My bad experience begins one day when I start to notice people peeling calloused skin off their palms after they rock climb. \u00a0Hey, its a rock climbing gym, it's going to happen right? \u00a0 However, I never really thought of that being an issue until I noticed some people doing it. \u00a0 \u00a0I began to realize that \"duh\" \u00a0people are going to blister from time to time while climbing these rock walls, but then what happens. \u00a0 \u00a0Well, over the course of a week or so, \u00a0I noticed some of these rock climbers who are peeling their palms were using the free weights after their morning climbing. \u00a0 \u00a0This made me question how clean the bars and weights were. \u00a0 \u00a0It just so happened that one morning, during my workout, I went to grab a barbell from the barbell stand and there it was....two chalky palm prints on the bar, the left one with sticky darkened red ooze covering exactly where the index and middle finger would join the palm. \u00a0 And the barbell below it, the same thing. \u00a0 \u00a0I started looking at all the barbells there. \u00a0 All of them have traces of chalk on them, and all of them have dark spotted areas on them similar to what the bloodied one looked like it was drying into. \u00a0 I decided in those brief moments that I was done at this gym and later that day I came back to sign my notice to quit. \u00a0 I did not give my true reason for leaving them then, I just did not want to hear an excuse or a sales pitch on their part trying to get me to stay. \u00a0 I was disgusted and just wanted to leave. \u00a0I reviewed their website afterwords and on the bottom left hand corner of their site there was a gallery with a picture of two calloused hands slightly bleeding. \u00a0That picture is not there as of this writing, but only a few short months ago it was. \u00a0 \u00a0 Which should have set off an alarm to me earlier if I had more thoroughly check their website before I signed up. So, to finish this off, again my 3 star review is complicated. \u00a0I give the place 5 stars for the type of gym that it is.5 stars on amenities, 4 stars on friendliness4 stars on my overall experience minus the callous picking and blood incident.And what can the Gym do to prevent people from lifting weights with blistered hands? \u00a0 \u00a0 I don't know. \u00a0 I suspect blistering hands are just part \u00a0of the rock climbing culture both on real rock and fake rock. \u00a0 \u00a0It's gonna happen, \u00a0 but somehow people need to be accountable for their own hygiene when handling the equipment. \u00a0 And I left because I don't believe this is something that the gym can ever completely control. I think it falls under the idea that everything a customer does there, is done at their own risk. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And I choose to not take part in that risk. \u00a0 \u00a0Good Luck.", "date": "4/7/2013"}

The gym I used to go to in Austria has much higher walls (about 3-4x the height of Diablo's) so the lower walls at Diablo are extremely disappointing. I don't feel as though I'm getting endurance training at all. My main issue however is that the staff at Diablo have an air about them like they're better than everyone. The one female staff member I've encountered has been very nice, but the male staff is intolerable. They need an attitude adjustment. Also, I don't know how familiar the staff is with climbing itself. It seems as though they are well trained in the Touchstone style of climbing but have no idea what other belaying devices are. At Touchstone they seem to only use GriGris and they expect people to treat other belaying devices the exact same way. I am confident in my belaying as I have been doing it many many times as well as fall training...NEVER have I ever let my partner fall to the ground. Touchstone gym members, however, are extremely bad at belaying. I'm sorry to say but your rigorous testings prove nothing; my belaying partner has complained that while belaying me, some other people fell on him. This is unacceptable. And I do think this is the gym's fault, since they've been teaching people how to belay. I've never seen this happen in the gym I go to in Austria, because the staff actually knows proper techniques and how to properly teach. So while I am an excellent belayer, because I don't use the same belaying technique, I have not been given a belay card (rather I get the 1-day passes) because the staff doesn't know what they're doing. It is extremely annoying. I will still go to the gym because it is the only one in the area but only because I'm desperate to climb.", "date": "1/26/2016"}

Our 11 year old son, after a previous visit to this gym, requested his birthday party be kept at this place. We called the Gym in advance to reserve, and were told that the reservation can only be done online and assured us it is easy, safe and secured (questionable). Setup the reservation online paying the deposit, and when we called the day before the event to ask questions regarding bringing in the pizza and cake, we were told \"There is NO reservation!\", and that there is nothing that can be done at this time. We had invited 16 kids to come from Lafayette and had no place to go. After calling back, the reservation was found, however made at Fresno Gym. We never inquired about any other locations and made the reservation on their site without getting any options to choose a different location. Now that the reservation was found, we are told that we still cannot come because they do not have staff. We offered to do ropes and we were told to come late that day for training. Once the staff part was resolved, we were told that they do not have a room to do the party in. After insisting for awhile, they offered their yoga classroom. Once we saw it we understood their hesitation... The room was smelling terrible and felt dirty and the chairs they provided looked like they were retrieved from a garbage bin as well as not enough of them. Dirty, ugly looking, or even smaller size. We had to ask for someone to do something about that smell so that we can bring the kids and have them fed. The check in process was slow, unpleasant and disorganized. We were embarrassed in front of the parents dropping of their children but for the staff it seemed normal. Most kids in our party within the hour and a half provided, they did the claim once or twice due to the overcrowding and long wait times. We were not at ease with the instructors that told 8-10 year old kids to claim the big boulders without the ropes. Three instructors were supposed to be assigned to our group, however we only saw one active and assumed that two other ones were talking to each other by the smaller boulders intended for the younger kids. Most staff was unpleasant to talk to or was talking to the kids in a \"somewhat rude\" and inpatient manner without explaining what was that they did wrong.The amount of stress that this particular part of our son's birthday celebration put on us was not worth the little fun the Gym provides. We believe it may be a great place to work out or claim but by no means they are ready or willing to host and welcome a group of kids coming all at once.", "date": "1/25/2015"}

As newbies, we opted for the intro course just so lovie can learn how to tie the knots and belay me so neither of us would fall 50 feet down. The class was longer than usual, but necessary. The place itself is super clean....from the layout of the area down to their restrooms. It wasn't too crowded in the morning, but as the day wore on, people started to fill in. They have an awesome bouldering area as well where you can pull up a mat and start climbing like Spiderman without a rope.

The next night, Esco and Heather, who'd missed the night before, took me to Diablo Rock - their \"home\" gym - so I was very excited.This is a really nice Touchstone gym, probably just a little smaller in size than Sacramento Pipeworks, and not as tall from what I can tell, but the same close and cozy atmosphere and style. The route setting here makes up for a lack in altitude with attitude; climbs are sequenced laterally as much as vertically, exercising traversal movement that isn't often tested in more vertical routes.The same care and attention to safety can be found here; I tested for my belay and THANKFULLY finally earned my permanent belay card!So we climbed. \u00a0I finished a 35-foot 5.8, \"Buenos Aires\", and ascended most of a 5.9, \"Porto Novo\"; as with its other gyms, Touchstone setters name its routes, sometimes thematically - a series of car names, engineering terms, tropical getaways, etc..

Seriously. What a great gym. The rock climbing is obviously AMAZING and it's so much fun you work out for hours without even noticing you're \"working out.\" You realize once your hands and arms give out though ; ) The bouldering area is amazing and such a great option too if you either don't have your partner with you or if you just feel like \u00fcber challenging yourself.As for the other equipment, it's excellent variety in that you can rock climb any day, or just work out on days you don't have a partner with you. People are super friendly too; my boyfriend has met some guys who are cool and swap tips and they belay each other when I'm not there with him to do it. Really, really cool environment. They offer fitness classes, which is obviously awesome, and you can use the pool as well (which technically belongs to the swim place next door). So much variety! Everyone on the staff is totally friendly and down to earth. The feeling you get from rock climbing is incomparable; you feel so accomplished and strong after you climb a wall you didn't think you could reach the top of, it's wonderful. And the soreness afterwards! You really know you worked your body well. Last but not least: there's lotion in the ladies bathroom. I know it sounds silly, but I'm a hand lotion addict. Especially after all that climbing and chalk and bouldering...it's so nice to get a nice pump of hand lotion complimentary :) considering this economy, places that offer such extras are A+ in my book!

Overall it's a fantastic gym - very open and inviting. I've never had a problem getting a weight/cardio machine even at peak hours of the day. Never have to wait for belay routes. Never have to wait for boulder routes. They offer classes every day (Yoga, Cycle, & Zumba) though I haven't checked any of them out yet (not big on classes). It's just a great place to get in, do your thing, shower, and go home. The staff are all very friendly and helpful. Bonus for me that it's 5 minutes from my house.Now the cons, because every place has them... Luckily there are only two, both of which I consider tolerable. The biggest \"meh\" I have with DRG is that it seems like they run a babysitting service from at least 4:45pm (when I usually arrive) until about 7-ish. During the week there's quite often a group of kids running around with one or two young guys monitoring them - MOST of the time. I've honestly had kids from that group climb up bouldering routes that criss-cross with mine first being below me and then above me (they're so quick!) to the \u00a0point where I have to pause my course because I don't want to have one of them fall/jump on me or vice versa. They often socialize at the bottom of belay climbs just swinging on the ropes (not climbing), or tear around the gym at high speeds. I understand it's the suburbs, but I'm there to work out, not to dodge children. There should be a level of maturity in these kids, otherwise they shouldn't be in a gym in the first place.The only other issue I've had is that the showers don't seem to get very hot. I don't need scalding, but something that is above lukewarm would be nice. I've been in the shower with it on as hot as it will go and still had goosebumps, and that's no good when all I want to do is wash the sweat out of my hair - I should have enough heat for a 7 minute shower that won't leave me shivering.Other than those two small issues, Concord is great, and even if these situations remain the same I will continue to go there because the pros of diverse and mostly available climbs/machines, relative tranquility, and proximity to my house definitely outweigh the random unruly children and less than hot showers.", "date": "5/26/2010"}

Friendly staff, good yoga classes and very social crowd, for the most part. I've been able to pick up random climbing buddies after hanging out in the bouldering pit a while, but on days when I don't want to talk to anyone and just want to climb, I can do that too. Towel service, steam room, sauna, pro shop (SNACKS!! need more calories to burn!), and plenty of folks around to help give tips and suggestions make this a good place to learn to climb. Seems like there's always a group of Boy Scouts, a birthday party, or multi-generational family group there in the afternoons and evenings, but the mornings are pretty quiet and calm if you prefer that. As of March 2011 they just got in new rental shoes, which is nice. Better to get your own if you want to stick to the walls on a regular basis, though. Oh yeah... REI is practically across the street (Willow Pass Road), so you can do that pretty easily. Check out their rope and bouldering competitions throughout the year, and get a membership so you can check out all the other Touchstone gyms. Totally worth it. I started out as a rookie last year, and between all the climbing and yoga I've done there, I feel fantastic.", "date": "3/16/2011"}

You can work on the machines (elliptical, treadmill, etc.) of course, but just the environment is nice. Small, isolated gym, but worth traveling to. I'm not a fan of gyms because of the many kinds of people that go there who are very vain. Here? You don't get that vibe. Everybody is doing their thing and not worried about what you do which is nice when you sometimes want to try something new without you having that feeling that others may be judging you.", "date": "12/11/2009"}

Now lets move onto the main event... the \"pool\". \u00a0If you are a swimmer and by swimmer I mean someone who swims... not someone who swims a lap or two and then lallygags for one end to the other - this \"pool\" is NOT for You! \u00a0It is perhaps the dingiest thing I have seen in a great while. \u00a0The entire \"pool\" is 3 ft-ish deep. \u00a0I'm 6'2\" and when I swim I don't like my fingers hitting the bottom, and although I am flexible and can get pretty compact during a flip turn, the water level is such that it is not sufficient enough for me to do one. To sum up the whole experience including the entire look of the \"pool\" SAD SAD & SAD!! Probably the WORST pool I've swam in since moving to CA. I'm sorry I wasted the money on the month of unlimited swimming.", "date": "2/1/2012"}
