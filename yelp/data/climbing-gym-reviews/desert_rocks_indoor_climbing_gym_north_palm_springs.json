That was kinda sad :( he didn't climb... went back to van.I stayed for about 1.5 hours and have to say their bouldering routes were ok.... warmed up with all the V.0, V.1 and most V.2s and usually can make a 4x4 with my work out, but their routes were hard, which is ok, but all seemed to be of the same 'type' without variation as they got harder, if that makes since. And the mat was a little on the very hard side for 'older' knees and didn't want to jump down from top, so down climbed everything. There were no downclimb assist holds.
