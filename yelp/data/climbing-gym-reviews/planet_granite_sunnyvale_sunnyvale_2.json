I top roped here for a few hours and on multiple occasions I saw people being really unaware in their lowering or swing off the wall and people not timing the routes correctly in the climbs. This place is so crowded that there was a lot of route crossing. One of the routes I liked best in the session I had to take a mandatory rest for 5 minutes because there was a guy crossing it and taking forever to send. So you will have oblivious climbers with bad manners here. When I tried to give feedback I didn't feel like I was understood, and the guy said, \"Well we can't stop people from climbing,\" which totally wasn't what I was getting at. I was more curious as to the route setting strategy. I really wish gyms would do more to step in when bad etiquette occurs and actively educate guests. \u00a0I don't recall seeing any staff on the floor observing. I am used to climbing at a small gym that I am so grateful for. The routes at PG will challenge you and I had multiple regulars tell me the grades are being set at higher difficulty levels lately. Possible reasoning I heard was to help acclimate people to outdoor grades. There was an awesome 5.9 set with long reaches and required a lot of use of the slab. There are also ladderish 5.8s and 5.9s and good routes that require balance work. It all depends. But if you go when it is busy you kind of have to take what you can get which is frustrating if you are looking for a specific grade and certain type of set. The saving grace here is the gym area and locker room. For you $28 day pass you get all access. Gym equipment is clean, lots of organized weights, multiple sets of rings, two moon boards, people are self-aware in the spaces they are using. The locker room has excellent showers and a nice sauna. Towels are provided. And unfortunately although there is signage a lot of people walk around the locker room and bathrooms in their climbing shoes, so fingers crossed you don't get pink eye on the holds. Another plus to this facility is the events. Friendly staff, easy belay cert if you know what you are doing and can communicate it well. I'll probably go back but wouldn't do so regularly and I doubt the cost of membership would be worth what you would have to deal with in terms of how busy this place is all the time.", "date": "5/10/2019"}

Today when I was advising the staff that they should *consider* having a discounted price because so many climb walls are under construction and not available. He said it is NOT possible. Out of goodwills, I listed out my reasons why I think discount should be considered. However, he kept giving me \"No\". Finally, I told him that I hope he can bring this up to the management team can discuss further. TBH, I expected them to *at least* tell me that they will consider this suggestion.

Planet Granite is famous around the Bay Area/Peninsula as one of the two major gym chains for rock climbing. With multiple locations in SF, Belmont, Sunnyvale, PDX, Planet Granite is slowly expanding its reach to all rock climbers. (Other chain in Touchstone which monopolizes the market down in SoCal and East Bay)For the nitty gritty logistics, PG Sunnyvale is the best rock climbing gym in the Bay Area. Hands up! The staff who run this gym are top notch and their coaches/teams are immensely impressive. The routes/trails are changed every month (at least) and the boulder areas span 4 wall areas, 2 in front and 2 in back. The top rope area is right in between and even when the gym is packed, people can still find time to climb in. Busiest times are of course weeknights starting 7PM. Best times to go are early mornings, late weeknights, or weekends! Weekends are pretty tame and most people who come are non-members/families. Besides rock climbing, PG offers FREE fitness classes and yoga every day! Rock climbing classes are extra $$ but I've heard it was fairly worth it. Expect to always see at least 1 guy topless-- you've been warned. Everyone is super friendly and more than happy to give pointers! I've made some good friends here and the love of the sport really brings the best out of people :)My friend, Ashley invited me to come along January 2nd of this year and her friend, Mark, guest'd me in-- after that I was hooked. PG had everything I was dying for- plenty of boulder and top rope routes, amazing amicable people (being around my age is bonus), nice (free) lockers and accommodations (showers, steam room, etc.), and a hefty area of weights and cardio machines for me to run off my boba.Luckily in January, they have a promotion where the initiation fee of $45 was waived and I signed up for the direct deposit of $95/monthly. Yes my wallet had an initial shock but I quietly whispered to it that it was going to be worth it. Now my New Years resolution of staying fit and healthy is still going strong. I go at least 3-4 times a week to PG to rock climb and cardio/weights. I have yet to top rope and take a class, but I will make a conscious effort to do so ASAP! My standards for a rock climbing gym are skyrocket high. Thanks Planet Granite for being my second home and a slice of heaven.", "date": "3/31/2018"}

So when I came here for a belay lesson with two other friends, I was not expecting a lot. Little did I know I was going to experience my best belay class ever! I've had maybe 4 belay lessons in my life spread out over my entire lifetime and I keep forgetting how to do it, so I did another class as a refresher. The instructor, JJ, was extremely clear, fun and friendly! The class took about an hour to an hour 15 min to complete with 4 people. I highly recommend taking a belay class here! At the end, they even give you a little cheat sheet of notes to keep in mind for taking the belay test when you come back. The cheat sheet also came with a couple coupons for 50% your next visit! SO AWESOME. Not only that, the instructor also gave us a length of rope so we can practice at home. TALK ABOUT GOING ABOVE AND BEYOND. This place is excellent and has a wide assortment of climbing and bouldering areas that'll definitely keep you entertained. I recommend going as early as possible, especially on the weekends. From 9-11am it was manageable to do climbs, but once it hit 11am-1pm, it was REALLY CROWDED. To the point where you had to wait for people to climb up and down before going up because a lot of the climbs are close together and zigzag with other ones. The only other downside is the price. For a day drop in pass, it's $28 NOT including the harness. That's another $5. Shoes are another $5. I believe chalk is $1. So if you don't have your own harness, shoes and chalk, you're looking at about $39 for a day pass. I live too far from here to get a membership, which is a little bit more than $1000/year.I'd probably come here every now and then to climb for a day pass price, especially because they have a rope with no knots to practice on hanging from the ceiling, which I've only seen at ClimbWorks in Berkeley and no other gyms I've gone to in the area (perfect for Spartan Race training!).", "date": "1/16/2018"}

They're organized by the colors of the holds, rather than colored tape that branch from the holds. 3. Many routes are very creatively set. Some have you zigzag a lot while others require the use of the naturals on the wall itself. (I uploaded a picture of my favorite route- it makes you climb up one side of an arch, grab holds at the high point of the arch, and literally swing so your momentum can allow your feet to reach a ledge on the other side of the arch- and then you continue climbing upwards. It was so challenging and creative!)4. Many sections have \"crack-only\" ascents if you're into that. 5. There are many bouldering options and a bouldering \"lap wall\". 6.

Yum!)Had a blast. Kind of pricey, but I'll be sure to come back. Thank you!", "date": "1/21/2017"}

This review will be coming from a olympic weightlifter, and is aimed towards weightlifters. I don't plan to rock climb; I'm deathly afraid of heights.First of all, I'm a weightlifter and I come here for the bumper plates, squat racks, and cardio machine because the price is reasonable. Other olympic weightlifting gym in the South Bay charge (crossfit gyms mostly) $200+ a month for one to just lift weights which I think is insane.  Also, there a super cool sauna that you can use.OBSERVATIONS: 1.Shoe policy seems to be lightly enforced, and even nonexistent. There are quite alot of gym goers here, who think it's ok to walk around barefoot, and this is especially noticeable in the free weights and squat rack areas. There are a number of people who will start squatting in the racks, or perform deadlifts without wearing shoes, and even socks!. Yuck. - This is very dangerous, especially if a weight falls on your foot. Sure, some footwear might not prevent alot of damage if this were to occur, but it's better than nothing. (take this advice from a weightlifter whose done this; bruised toes hurt like ****, even with a shoe on.)- Going around shoeless is very unsanitary. Self-explanatory. There are parts of the free weight/crossfit flooring that smell like stinky feet. Gross. You don't want to pick up someone else's foot fungus, nor do you want your children too right? (So please leave your shoes on!)2. During the weekdays, 4pm-6/7pm can get ridiculously busy. Especially as the clock hits 6pm, an influx of people come for the crossfit class. Definitely try to plan around or avoid this time block, if you want to use the free weights. If you come in the morning during a weekday, the gym is nearly empty.3. Bathroom, showers, and locker room seem decently clean, especially for the amount of people who are constantly in and out. Sometimes the trash bin overflows, but it's not a deal breaker. Locker usage is complementary, and all you need is to bring a lock. The inside of some lockers can be dirtier than others. There's a paper towel dispenser and a hand dryer, so you can choose between which to use.4. Equipment: There are more than a dozen barbells, both women 35lbs and mens, so that's cool. Lots of gym only have men 45 lbs barbells. There are 3-4 Rogue 2.0 barbells, and I've done some snatched and Clean and Jerks on them. They're pretty decent. Sleeves spin well. Knurling is ok.You can also bring your own barbell in if you choose; you can't store it overnight though. 5. Chalk: A BIG BONUS! Since this is a rock climbing facility, chalk use is very much welcomed! This is awesome, as lots of commercial gyms ban and look down about chalk. The weightlifting area has 2 bags of chalk that anyone can use. 6. Parking can sometimes be difficult to find, depending on what time you come. Also, the way the parking spots are arranged takes some getting use to. Each lane of parking spots alternates in the direction they travel, as the lanes are all one way only. These are my observations for now, and I'll probably update this later.", "date": "12/11/2016"}

Lots of variety with a range of difficulties. I also like the regular gym section, although I wish they had more than one stair stepper and the weights/stretching area is always super crowded. \u00a0Most of the climbers have good etiquette but I have seem some improper belaying and people climbing too close to each other and falling/kicking folks next to them in the head. That was pretty scary to witness. \u00a0I've taken some of the yoga classes and I am really happy with them. Overall this is a great, well rounded gym for those interested in training for mountaineering and other outdoorsy activities and general wellness.My major critique is that some patrons bring their young (like, toddler age) kids over to the weights/stretching area which is SUPER dangerous. They completely disregard people who are carrying around heavy weights or are on the mats doing planks, etc. Their kids run around *at their own peril* and get in the way of people trying to work out. Today there was a man rolling a yoga ball back and forth with his three year old, right in the middle of the floor exercises mats. I have submitted comment cards to the management and they've completely disregarded me. Safety for everyone should be their first concern and it clearly isn't.", "date": "3/5/2017"}

My friends go weekly so I joined in. It was fairly quick to join, signing a waiver, renting shoes/harness for $6 and watching a safety video. I have long nails so I was told by 3 ppl to cut them short which I was sad about. They had nail clippers at the front so I guess it's common to make ppl clip their nails. Then it was straight to the climbing walls! I was a little intimidated though it didn't look like anyone cared how well you did. I did the \"easiest\" bolder climbing one and got scared close to the top and came down. It took some encouragement from my friends but I went back at it. Each time, I got less scared and maybe a tad more confident until I finally reached the top! Took an hour but at least I did it. Then we moved to the belay climbing wall where you're harnessed. Went up to the top with no problem and then tried some of the harder ones. I'm scared of heights so to be able to do this was great. I think starting with bouldering makes sense and then to belay since it's higher. When I asked, \u00a0I one could tell me which one was easier so hopefully that helps. There were kids doing both which was awesome! After, we worked out on the machines, enjoyed the sauna etc. I just did a guest pass but I'm considering joining - it was a really great workout!

The belay class schedule is:Monday - Friday: 6pm, 7pm and 8pm; Tues, Weds & Thurs also at 5pm.Saturdays: 10am, 11:30am, 1pm, 2pm, 3:30pm and 4:30pmSundays:9:30am, 10:30am, 11:30am, 12:30pm, 1:30pm, 2:30pm and 3:30pThe class is about an hour. You learn safety checks, how to belay (the person who is controlling the ropes for the person who is climbing), and do an entry practice climb. The class is $30 and includes your rentals. You'll get a temporary belay card so you can get out there and climb on your first day. You can't get a permanent one until you pass the belay test, but you can't take the test same day. If you decide you enjoy climbing, you can purchase the 5 visits for $70 special one-time deal (I believe the cost of the pass can go towards your initiation fee as well, if you decide to become a member).RETURNINGNext time you come, take the belay test. If you pass, you get a permanent one. Depending on how badly you fail, you'll get a temporary card so that you can practice more. The belay test is some questions about what you're safety checks are, how you tie the knots, and to demonstrate belaying (getting ready, belay as the climber climbs, climber stops, climber slips, and climber descend). Refresh your memory with the videos on the site: planetgranite.com/sv/cli\u2026.Rates are $25 for a day pass (this varies across PG locations in the Bay). Rentals are $6 for shoes and harness. Membership rates are $88/month, initiation rate is $45.FACILITIESThis location is half rock climbing facility and half gym. There are normal weights and treadmills as well as yoga class offerings. The bathrooms and showers were clean and looked fully stocked. The rock climbing side had a variety of wall levels and bouldering areas. There are only a few super beginner walls (levels lower than 5) but might as well push yourself with the level 7-8 walls. There are lockers in the bathroom, but there isn't a secure location near the walls to put your stuff, so just don't bring valuables.TIPSWhat to wear: comfortable, form-fitting clothes that won't get in your way while you climb or flash anyone below you.What to bring: water bottle and socks.What to expect: calloused hands and being super sore for the next few days.

I've been going here for almost 2 years and love it everything I go.The only downs to this place is that it's pretty expensive compared to the other gyms. I understand inflation and maintenance but it still hurts every month. Parking here during peak hours is horrific. Sometimes you have park at the far end of the lot because there are so many people and it doesn't help that the lot is shared with several other companies. It's kind of hard to avoid peak hours because most people have 9-5 jobs so the only time you can go is early in the morning, which isn't bad but after work it's painful. Sometimes you'll be waiting awhile because so many people want to climb the problems you want to do. This goes for both bouldering and top roping. I've used the weights area and cardio machines and in general everything is well maintained. Although some of the cardio machines could be wiped down more often. I've seen cleaner machines at an active 24 hours. It's great that it offers yoga, spin and cross-fit. I've been to the yoga classes before and it is no joke.

I can go on, but hopefully this review gives you pause if you are considering hosting a party there.My gripe is that they say they totally host birthday parties.

Never been to their Oregon branch. \u00a0Mostly, size matters in this industry. A 20' by 20' wall is going to feel short and boring quickly where as several 70'+ routes will feel refreshing.Sunnyvale provides enough wall space that their route rotation can effectively bring in new routes. (such as you will see new routes about every 4 weeks) The other plus is how diverse their setting team is. Typically I try to be blind to who set the route before I have ascended it enough. It is nice to get to know who are making your problems. \u00a0--------------------------------What do I get out of Sunnyvale that Belmont doesnt have?: Belmont is smaller, shorter and generally just a mini version of Sunnyvale. Sunnyvale gives you more similar routes so you can train at several levels on vertical no overhang vs having major overhang and everything in the middle.Belmont does have more specialized sections, 2 vs 1 chimney and cracks and flakes that are better integrated and better representational of real world rock formations. Often Belmont has fewer climbers per their wall space which can be attractive when you are almost armpit to armpit at Sunnyvale (comparing weekday peak to peak times).The bouldering is clearly healthy and vibrant at Sunnyvale. Belmont just doesnt have the real-estate for bouldering. --------------------------------PRICING: I've strategized with their owner on how to diversify their audience and sadly that isnt something that can be agreed upon. \u00a0This is where I'm split on the fence. If you can pay out right for monthly memberships on an ongoing basis, that is the best plan (assuming you are climbing at least 2 times a week + other activities at PG). \u00a0That said if you want to get price to not be contingent on frequency then the price point is quite significant towards your pleasure rating.", "date": "3/8/2017"}

They also play absolutely god-awful 90's crap rock (like MatchBox 20) that makes you want to slit your wrists instead of getting pumped in the evening for your climb/workout.Similarly, the weights here suck. I appreciate that they have a bigger space where you can do weightlifting/crossfit-type exercises on your own; but the hand weights, pre-loaded bars, and weight machines all appear to be older pieces of crap. A bit disappointing seeing how much money you drain each month for the privilege of being there.Next, the place is quite messy. I went into the bathroom and two of the three toilets had mountains of paper/excrement sticking out like a small, disgusting island. There is also always piles of dark hair in the sinks, and the weights are never in the right place when you're looking for them. Perhaps if the attendants spent less time putting gel in their hair and more time focused on the gym, this would improve.And finally, there are so. many. damn. kids... and they're all seemingly out of control. They run around screaming/stepping on things and do whatever the hell they want. This is probably why PG forces everyone to use Grigris instead of ATCs while climbing (which is a HUGE eye roll/pain in the ass), because of all the clueless, idiotic kids running around. I'm afraid for what the next generation will look like if this sample is any representation of how they're all being raised. But perhaps that's a reflection of this part of the Bay Area itself rather than the gym...To add a few of the good parts, they do have much more climbing space than was at GWPC, and it is significantly bigger. They also have many more yoga and workout classes, which is a plus (though I've yet to attend one). The locker room is also larger and has a sauna, and there's plenty of parking as well. My favorite bonus was that they let you split your membership with your \"partner\" if you're living together but not married, which was fantastic. If you lead climb, you can also test on any climb in the gym as opposed to one designated area.So all in all, it's a good, solid gym. But for the human interactions and \"bang for your buck\" in comparison to anything Touchstone Climbing offers, I gave it three stars. They need to make some changes and up their game a bit. That, or perhaps I should just lower my standards.", "date": "11/29/2016"}

But since I don't come here enough to make a membership worth it, I go for the $30 one-day fee every time. $24 is the day rate, and you can get a harness and shoe rental for another $6. Even when it's crowded here, you can always find space to climb. It's a gigantic gym with so many different walls and a variety of difficulty levels. If you want to climb the taller walls you do need someone who has a belaying permit/card thing to belay you. I know they offer lessons/training for those who want to learn. I've heard that passing the test is pretty easy. And it opens up so many more climbing options! The people here are also super awesome. Everyone is very respectful/mindful of those climbing around them, so I really like the environment here. Climbing is more of a workout than you would think--and it's not just arms! But for those of you who don't want to climb for too long, you can also take advantage of their gym equipment in the back. I think they also have yoga classes? Overall, it's a great facility and I'll definitely come back again every now and then to climb :)", "date": "10/23/2015"}

After our lesson we were able to climb on our own, even up up to 5.6 and 5.7. We bought the 5 day passes for $55. We came back this past weekend to climb again. We had to take the test for a temporary card, and we couldn't remember what to do. Thank goodness they didn't give us a permanent card because it's good to refresh our memories. Safety is the number one thing here! Luckily one of the girls was nice enough to go over it with us! We have 4 more passes to use before October so we are looking forward to getting some climbs in before they expire. It's such a good work out! It's a fun sport that we can do and try together. Since neither of us have done this before it's kinda cool that we can start on the same level and grow together. It's also good for relationship or team building because learning to baley and climb is built upon trust! You have to trust each other, be able to communicate effectively and safely, and help each other make it to the top! You also have to encourage and help one another if you see him/her struggling. It's a perfect sport for couples and would be fun for dates. If you're single, there's always someone looking for a partner.

If you're looking to climb casually to meet other singles, this is probably for you.I've been climbing for 7 years and have climbed at several gyms around the country and internationally. If you've ever been to one of Planet Granite's gym locations, it's no surprise to expect a big hub of people to meet other people after work (and/or school). It's big and they offer a lot. It's a franchise. At this particular location, it draws a bunch of well-paid engineer guys (duh, silicon valley) and 20 to 30 something aged women. I've stopped by a handful of times and enjoyed climbing here but realizing that I'm climbing above my normal grade than at my home gym (Santa Rosa's Vertex Climbing Gym). An example is I'm usually working V4's and V5's solidly and I came into this gym flashing V4's / V5's and working on a V8. Community? I don't see it. I think if you're 'really good' you'll end up striking a conversation with the crowd that looks like they're 'dirt bag climbers', but every time I step in there, every person looks less than welcoming. I walked past a person or persons that I smiled at because I'm just a friendly person and they avoid eye contact, giving you the impression that they're a complete snob. Huge gym. I don't feel cramped the times I went since there's a lot of accommodating open space (indoors and outdoors). Lots of rope routes and an indoor and outdoor bouldering spot. Despite the open doors and fans, it's still REALLY hot. Excellent gym work out area, too. Bathrooms are clean and spacious, which is similar to the other gym locations by them.Couldn't believe we paid $48 total for day fees for the two of us.

Even though I was already belay certified there, the fact that she said that was just so shocking and rude. She has a condescending attitude and really needs to quit it.

I loved being a PG member and feel that the quality of the 3 PG gyms is higher than other climbing gyms in the Bay Area (ie. Mission Cliffs, Iron Works) in that the routes are regularly swapped and the grips on the rocks are not worn down from overuse or dirtiness. Staff has always been friendly, helpful and efficient. One of my friends dislocated his elbow once (very poor landing from bouldering) and the staff reacted very quickly and knowledgeably.Benefits of Sunnyvale: best parking of the three gyms (SF has a metered parking lot and Belmont is free street parking). It's a larger gym with tons of bouldering options. Good amount of regular gym equipment. Comparatively, SF is sort of hard to get to without a car, and the cherry on top is you have metered parking when you finally get there. Belmont is nice, but smaller.Cons: working out in the general gym area (ex. ellipticals, treadmills) is very stuffy and air circulation is not good at all. Even if you had the simplest workout of your life, I am certain you will end up sweating just from the heat.Notes: It gets REALLY crowded, at the predictable times (weekdays after work). Weekends is a ghost town at opening hours which is when I would recommend coming. Weekend late afternoons also die down a little and you have to find the sweet spot that avoids the children's rock climbing parties. Unfortunately, a membership doesn't make economic sense unless you come more often than just the weekends, so you are going to have to suck it up and brave the crowds at some point.The most annoying thing about PG is their membership offerings and that you must either fully cancel or else pay to have your membership frozen when you are away.", "date": "7/27/2015"}

Aside from bouldering and belay climbing, you get yoga, fitness, functional fitness, personal trainers, as well as access to their gym area lumped into your membership.And here is where I find fault in their pricing model. I am an avid boulderer, so I come here for bouldering/belay climbing, not yoga, not a weight gym. And for me to pay $24 for a day pass or $69 for a monthly membership, I feel ripped off. And their student day pass of $18 is only valid Mondays-Fridays before 5pm?? AIN'T NOBODY GOT TIME FOR DAT. Ideally, they would divvy up their accesses so people who only want to boulder could pay a lower fee instead of offering a one-size fits all deal. Because those one-size fits are usually the worst. In Seattle, I would pay $12/day for a student day pass, but that's another story.Aside from that, the routes are well-maintained, and even some of the V1's-V2's make me sweat. The routes here seem a bit more challenging per level than they seemed to be in Seattle Bouldering Project. Some routes here feel inconsistent; some V1's feel easier than V2's, and some V2's feel easier than V3's. There is even an age-restricted area that offers much more difficult routes with challenging overhanging routes for experienced climbers. The gym is huge, and good for it because this place gets busy during weekday nights! For members, they offer a free informative belay lesson where any day after, you can get \"certified\" if you pass a belay test, thus granting you access to the roped rock climbing area. Their belay system is centered in a device called the Grigri. They give announcements to the entire gym if there's a solo climber looking for a belay partner. The rock climbing walls tend to test your endurance more. On the bouldering walls, the difficulty is more sustained and concentrated and the bouldering problems are always interesting. The staff is friendly, but often slow and forgetful when it gets busy. Great gym overall, terrible pricing model.Strong 3 to a Light 4", "date": "9/13/2015"}

Before today, I've only done rock climbing at city beach with the automatic belay systems which was so much easier compared to this. Afterwards, I rock climbed for about 1.5 hours.

I had to buy it!!! The deal is only valid if you purchase it the day of your lesson. What I also loved about this place was that they had a whole gym set up inside.

I like this gym a lot. The staff is all really friendly, especially for a Bay Area joint. The location is really convenient with a huge parking lot, and not in a super high trafficy area like downtown. They have a significant student discount, so I was able to keep in climbing shape while visiting my parents for 3 weeks without burning a hole through the wallet. I only use this gym to boulder. The routes are challenging and there is a good variety of easy ones and difficult ones. I do feel like the walls are slightly over crowded, but that could just be because I am used to the opposite back in Raleigh. I definitely challenged myself here and worked on some different looking routes.The only thing is that it gets super crowded and chaotic. Last time I was here there were four kids running around in circles going crazy right under me while I was trying to focus on climbing. I also think that a tour of the facility (or at least a small mention of \"locker rooms are back there\", \"we have a sauna\", etc etc) would be helpful for first timers. I didn't realize there was an entire back bouldering room for ages 14+ until my second visit. Speaking of which, I LOVE the idea of the age restricted bouldering zone, especially with those crazy kids running around the main part. Overall, this is a great community to be part of in in the Bay Area. The other climbers are considerate and may even offer suggestions.

Come in here with a good attitude, and that will be reciprocated.Enough of these reviews say what Planet Granite has; including decently high walls, various classes, cardio and strength equipment, an oft-ignored sauna, events, BBQs, all that stuff. Let's talk about what's missing:- No features wall.- No traverse route. Hard to free climb a traverse with the amount of people as well.- No auto-belay system.- And no \"buddy program\" for top-roping. If you come alone but want to top-rope, they will just make an announcement over the speaker. If you're female, you'll be good to go. If you're a dude, you're SOL. Such is life.- No beginner bouldering routes (VB), so it's hard to introduce first-timers to it. You have to go straight to top-roping which has a lot of kiddie routes.- Only whole number ratings for bouldering. I prefer the more specific + and - system, which gives you a good idea of what you're getting in to.- Bouldering routes are taped, but not nearly as organized and easy to read as the top-roping here. And putting a red taped route next to an orange taped route is all sorts of confusing.Biggest qualm: Don't come here after 3 pm / before 8 pm. There are kids running around unsupervised, crawling on routes with bare feet or sneakers, touching other people's stuff, and just generally being obnoxious. More adult supervision needed in this regard.Membership: $75 a month. Access to all Planet Granite locations. One guest pass every other month. Guest night on the first Friday of every month. Free belay class for up to two friends anytime with advance appointment. (Great way to introduce them to climbing). Access to all classes. Small discounts to save you a few quarters. ***Downside is that you can only charge your membership to a checking account.Safety: PG appears to be very strict in enforcing appropriate belay technique, which I applaud. Safety first :) However, I have seen LOTS of people belaying who were NOT resting in the brake position and no staff ever appeared to have a problem with this. I understand that PG uses only gri-gri's, so it's not too much of a problem in-gym. But as someone who had a pretty bad belay experience with an ATC, when you get used to resting outside of the brake position, you are developing a bad habit that could definitely come back to bite you in the future.", "date": "8/28/2013"}

I got a chance to try out cycling with Max and yoga with Melody. Cycling with Max was interesting in that I never had an instructor that closed his eyes for most of the course. Power yoga with Melody was amazing and left me feeling refreshed -- I highly recommend! Now as for membership costs... it's quite steep. It's very much understandable why, though... because any cheaper, we wouldn't be able to waddle through during peak times haha. You are paying for value!

I've been going to mostly rock climbing gyms in southern california which are only 1/4 the size of planet granite. This place is HUGE!!! About 4x the size of climbing gyms i am used to. \u00a0There are tons of top ropes, lead climbs, and bouldering routes. The walls are very tall, which builds great stamina. Its great that not all the walls are 50-60 feet tall which is great for beginners and people who tire out. Honestly, i only had about a couple big wall climbs in me. Routes are really well thought out and have a lot of creativity in them. The variety in the top roping walls in amazing! I couldnt climb all the routes in a day if i tried. I have to say the ratings on the wall are a bit easier than i am used to, a 5.10a at a climbing gym in socal is somewhat difficult, but here I felt like the 5.10s were equivalent to some 5.8s at other gyms.. or maybe i'm getting stronger?The bouldering area is a really good place to bring beginner friends. The routes are challenging, yet very doable. I love that the floors are made of up really soft mats across the entire bouldering area, which makes it feel extra safe. The area is plenty big so it doesnt get too crowded.The gym area is an actual gym, tons of treadmills and weights. I can totally see this doubling as a climbing gym/regular gym. Everything was clean and there didnt seem to be a huge wait for any of the machines. The shower/locker room area is really big, and clean, there were showers and a sauna!Overall the facility is great, i only give it four stars as the staff was rather off putting. When i came in, there was only one person in line, and i had to wait about 20 minutes as the three people behind the desk, seemed to be pre-occupied. When i did finally get serviced the staff was rather rude when requesting that i take a belay test, they told me to tie in, and then wave them over, easier said than done, they were ignoring me. During the belay test, they seemed to come in doubting my belay abilities (i've climbed consistently at other gyms i know how to belay). Rude staff aside, i had a great time at the facility and i would definitely come back again when i am in the Bay Area", "date": "9/2/2013"}

Members also get a free guest pass every odd month so I try to use that pass whenever he gets one :DThe majority of Planet Granite is the rock climbing area. There's bouldering walls and top roping. They change up the routes on the walls every once in awhile so you won't be doing the same thing every time you're here. Other members here are really friendlly which makes it seem more like a community. Every time I've come here, a stranger has helped me when I'm stuck on the wall by guiding me to the end of the route! Thanks to a random guy we met twice, I completed my first V2 after only climbing like.. 5 times :D I LOVE the yoga classes here! I've only taken the Power Yoga and Partner Yoga classes with Doris and both are great! She is super nice and charismatic and will help you with your form. Her power class is pretty challenging at times and will push you to new limits. The partner yoga class is super fun! I highly recommend it if you have a significant other :) It is a great idea for a date! You also don't need to come to the class with a partner. Sometimes people find partners there in class! Usually when I come here, there's people outside the yoga class practicing AcroYoga which looks SO COOL. A friend of mine has learned some moves just by asking these people to teach him! Maybe one day I will too :DThere's also a weights and cardio machines area. So if you want to just lift weights, use the elliptical or treadmill, those options are there too! And since most people are usually there for climbing, this area is not very crowded which means you don't have to wait to use anything.If I lived closer to PG I would totally get a membership. You get SO MUCH from it! Getting a membership at a yoga studio or crossfit gym cost much more than a membership at PG and at PG, you get BOTH and more!

I've taken a few yoga classes with different instructors and found them all excellent, but none of the others. Definitely a nice perk of the membership.They host several events you can take advantage of if you're a single climber looking for a partner or just other like-minded people to climb with--Beta Babes, Trivia Night, Singles & Swingers (this one gets really crowded) are the ones I've participated in at one time or another.

I climb a 5.10b at Mission Cliffs, and struggle with 5.9 (!) at Brooklyn Boulders. At Planet Granite 5.10c is readily approachable.

They change them quite often and have challenging/interesting aspects to the climbs that make it fun to go to every other day for me. The only thing I dislike at times is that it gets so busy on weeknights.. but I guess when you have a gym culture that is open and dynamic, it draws people in... LOVE this place. Also, there's always a few out of order treadmills - which can get a bit frustrating on a busy night.

Gym 3.5 stars They have a decent selection of gym equipment but it gets pretty busy like most public gyms. They don't have a bench press so you have to hog the squat rack if you want to bench press. The membership also included their cross fit classes which seems like a tremendous value since those can be pretty expensive.

It's a little pricey -- $20 for a day pass. The rentals are extra. I got tested to belay, and the staff member taught me some things I did not know. He was extra friendly, and was super patient with me since I was used to belaying with an ATC. If I lived closer, I would definitely get monthly membership because not only is there climbing, but they have fitness machines and weights as well as a sauna, locker room, and showers. THIS PLACE HAS EVERYTHING IN ONE! Of all the climbing gyms I've been to, they either have more bouldering, climbing only, or more top roping. This place has top roping, bouldering, AND lead climbing. They have climbs of different levels from V0 to even V7. They probably do go higher, but I didn't really look around for all the different levels. The top rope climbs are pretty awesome, and there are lots of people take classes the day of who can belay you.Overall, this is honestly the BEST climbing gym I've been to so far.

Our instructor Amy is pretty chill, but informative and amiable. It is, however, really packed during the class time (I'm in the 7pm class), so it can be kind of difficult to find a spot for me to climb, since I'm still stuck doing somewhat low numbers. (I am the confirmed climbing dunce of my class.) My friend has an easier time since she can tackle higher numbers, and there are understandably few routes below a 5.5 for awful climbers like me. It seems like everyone rockets out to 5.7 or higher after their first week... except in short bus special cases like me, LOL.Overall, the place is really, really expensive. This may simply be coming from someone who doesn't do gym memberships because she typically can't stand the overpowering smell of the cleaners used in many of them (not a problem here, it smells more like old leather shoes all the time, almost certainly because of all the rental climbing shoes). I also make a pittance compared to the average Silicon Valley resident, so there is that as well. Take it with a grain of salt, as what I consider expensive may be quite reasonably priced for you. They do try to be an all-in-one gym with the rock climbing at the forefront and a bunch of cardio equipment and some free weights in the back. I haven't tried any of the classes yet, but I hear they're not bad.Also, it is REALLY COLD in there in the evenings, at least during February. I'm originally from Hawaii, but even my East Coast-born friend finds it a little cool for her tastes. There's a sauna in the bathroom, but I haven't tried it yet--I keep meaning to, but end up leaving too late in the evening.I'll probably be back, although I suppose I can't afford to do it too often after this. My work schedule would make coming here regularly enough to justify the membership tough, because I am frequently stuck working overtime on projects that probably should not have been planned out by folks two levels above the actual grunts, but I would like to at least make it back a couple of times a month.

Climbing just isn't for me! :)The GOOD: I love the instructors here! Misako is awesome, Lorraine kicks your butt every time, and all of the other instructors I have had I have really liked as well. Their lunchtime yoga classes are a perfect break from the workday. The Tuesday evening Pilates class was great (when the instructor didn't have the sub that gets confused with her lefts and rights) but I'm not sure if/when it will return. The class times are also very convenient and the staff at the front are always friendly. The locker rooms are simple but nice and clean and the rates are really reasonable considering everything that is included.The BAD: The yoga studio is nice, but cleanliness is iffy. I always have to check the floor around me when we do poses that are hard to keep on your mat because there is all sorts of hair and other stuff on the studio floor that will stick to you quite nicely when you are working up a sweat. I don't expect it to be immaculate, but who knows when the last time they swept/mopped was (and by the looks of it, not recently) not to mention the thought of all the heebie jeebies that you can get from the gym (ex: ringworm) it would be nice if they would clean the floors after each class. Also the weightlifting area is right on the other side of the wall, so you hear the burly dudes picking up and dropping the heaviest barbell they can find while you are trying to meditate or get your nap on during savasana. I absolutely get that Planet Granite is a climbing gym first and a yoga studio possibly last...but with the classes being more and more packed every month, I would give it 5 stars if the yoga studio got a little more TLC and the cardio equipment were on the other side of the wall instead of the Crossfit folks.", "date": "9/7/2013"}

It's hard to describe, so here is a list...Why is Planet Granite amazing?1. TALL 60 ft walls! This not only makes it more fun, but also helps with building stamina and mimics outdoor conditions.2. Cleanliness and organization! Planet Granite is well-ventilated as opposed to smelly, and the holds and ropes are all in great condition. The routes are all well-labeled and unlike at most OC/LA gyms, the colors of the holds are obvious and placed in ways to reduce confusion. This helps with concentrating on the climb instead of trying to figure out which holds you're supposed to use.3. Interesting routes! Planet Granite is SO HUGE so there's the luxury of setting all sorts of routes using all sorts of space. I pretty much never have an issue with climbs that are simply too reachy for me (I'm 5'2''), unlike at certain other gyms where either they do not have enough holds to build a route for short people, or they do not consider this. There are also all sorts of interesting rock features here and different types of holds, so climbers can develop all sorts of climbing techniques! In terms of the difficulty level, Planet Granite is definitely on the easy side. It might be hard to climb outdoors after only climbing at Planet Granite. I mostly climb around 5.10d/5.11a here, but have climbed 5.11b. 5.11s are too hard for me outdoors.4. Variety of climbing AND other activities. There is a spacious lead area, crack climbing area, top roping area, and bouldering area (with super cushy floors). There is also slacklining, rope climbing, and a bunch of cardio and strength training equipment (for crossfit!), as well as acrobatic looking things. People on the cardio equipment face the climbers, so they will never get bored! There is also yoga!5. It's a community! Planet Granite hosts interesting events and competitions with food and everything. Also, they will announce over the intercom if someone needs a belay partner. That seems so helpful!6. Family-friendly. There are a lot of easier routes, so people can bring their children or perhaps those who may be less strong. Some of those easier routes look so cute, like the alphabet ones!7. Amenities. You can borrow towels! And there is a water fountain! This may not sound like much to some, but there are some gyms that have neither :/ There are also showers and saunas. Sooooo nice.8. Rates: Okay, the day pass rate isn't great, but the membership is a steal. If I lived in Norcal I would get the membership...it is inclusive of access to the gym equipment, crossfit, and yoga. Lucky people up North!Verdict: Planet Granite Sunnyvale basically has everything.", "date": "6/29/2013"}

Plenty of space and all the equipment I need. I don't run much tho so you'd be on your own as far as finding a place to run. The climbing is everything I would have hoped for in this gym.Minus 1 star, and maybe even 2, for the smell. Not the smell of the gym, but peoples feet. I know the gym is clean because I've been there when its empty on the weekend, no smell whatsoever. But when its packed, and everyone is barefoot this place is pretty tough to tolerate. it actually turned me off from joining for years, im actually still not a member. I think PG should make shoes mandatory at all times. not only does it smell when people are barefoot but it's also just not hygenic. I did a burpee the other day and [jokingly] wondered if i would get athletes chin from hitting my chin. im sure all it took was one person to walk around with athletes foot. then 100 other people did, and now it smells 100x worse because everyone has athletes foot. So great gym as far as equipment and routes to climb, but they should really regulate dress code here. Shoes should be required. Also, the whole shirtless thing from the scrawny guys is kinda weird, but i guess i'm ok with that compared to the no shoes. i saw one girl with flip flops once. im glad she at least had that decency not to spread her foot sweat everywhere. no bare feet people, COME ON MAN! pretty gross. well im about to go climb, need to get prepared to hold my breath.", "date": "3/11/2013"}

I've gone rock climbing when I was young but never came back. Then I bought a groupon and woo hoo this place is awesome! I've never been to any other rock climbing gym but I heard this one and the one's in SF are some of the best indoor gyms ever!! Not only do they have rock climbing but they also have a full gym, nice locker rooms, yoga classes, spinning classes, etc. I know some of the yoga instructors that teach at my favorite regular studio that also teach here and they're amazing. It is not your typical lame yoga classes like at the YMCA. I've topped roped (the one with the rope) and I have bouldered (shorter walls but without anything helping you. I'm a huge fan of bouldering. If you want to top rope you'll need a belay partner. Which can be tricky if you go alone, but they'll always help you find someone. And you'll need to take a belay training and a test before you are certified to belay someone. Btw, they don't let you take the test the same day that you take the class. They get very crowded in the evening starting around 4-5pm all the way until about 9:30pm. In the afternoon and mornings it is really quiet so if you like to be in your own zone then I'd go at the earlier or super late hours. If you want some help and want to socialize with hundreds of climbers come during rush hour! The only problem with that is that you have to wait your turn. So you don't get a lot of climbing done with time that you are there. Check the website for rates but they're pretty reasonable! If you just want to try this place out and have a friend that has a membership then ask them to get you in! We get day passes and get a free guest the first Friday of every month after 5pm! Oh and one more thing I recommend. If you take the belay class, buy their package deal for their gear. It's something like $120 for harness, shoes, and a chalk bag. Great deal for beginners and then you don't have to wear their rental shoes which, if you ever stuck your nose in them, are disgusting!!", "date": "1/14/2013"}

It's been a while since I've been to any other climbing gym, but this is really as good as it gets. The location is great, the desk people are helpful and super cool, and the walls are changed up pretty regularly for different types of challenges. They have bouldering, top roping, and even lead climbing; all in different difficulty levels to suit everyone. The only warning is that because it's so good it does get really crowded at times (especially after work).The day passes are $20 and rentals are $6 (harness and shoes), which is a bit on the pricey side, but is okay if you don't want to do the membership (which runs about $70 a month). If you know someone with a membership, they get free passes every now and then if you want to give it a shot without actually committing. The only thing you need to belay is the belay card, which you can get by taking the test at the before you climb. If you don't know the knots/how to belay, they offer free lessons which also mean you get to climb for the rest of the day for free (just have to sign up beforehand for the class).The staff seems really cool though. There was one time I only brought cash (left my wallet in the car), but was a dollar short and the guy still let me get my rental equipment for a \"discounted\" price instead of making me go all the way back to my car. Very cool.They also have \"normal\" gym equipment there as well (treadmills, weights, etc.) for people who don't want to climb and yoga classes I believe. This place is really huge for what it is (3 bouldering walls and really long climbs, which I absolutely love!); even then, you might find yourself waiting for a wall to free up every now and then. Since it's so crowded, you should always be aware of your surroundings too, cause there are always people dropping down.

They have a number of each for all levels. I'm always in awe watching people tackle harder climbs. You learn a lot watching people and tend to push yourself more after seeing the dedication from the people around you. PG also offers a full gym with classes like crossfit, cycling, yoga, etc. I havent taken any yet but they seem to be well received amongst my peers. While membership seems a bit pricey at first, its actually a great deal. Considering you pay $20 each time to climb w/o a membership, it could quickly add up.

The grandeur and scope of the engineering and construction makes you awe at the walls even after a hundredth visit. Fitness, yoga, and climbing what more could you need? This gym and the entire family of Pg gyms get 5 stars from me. My only complaints would be the subtle yet persistent encroachment of screaming macho crossfit people in the fitness areas, maybe one summer we can add-on a crossfit only wing to the gym complete with acoustics to make all the screaming even louder and more impressive. Lastly I think the planet granite family needs to consider some additions into its route setting philosophy by considering the inclusion of routes that are maybe more dynamic, more sequence intensive, and in general more extreme.

They have many routes for all levels of difficulty. It's even spread out enough to not look like a clusterf*** of a wall. The abundant walls itself is fantastic by the pure complexion and geometry of it. They also have another bouldering section in the back that scales pretty high, but don't fret, the pads make you feel secure enough to not worry about falling flat on your back (Even if you need a spotter). BTW you will see some dudes that climb with their shirts off. I honestly don't mind, but if you're doing a freakin' v2 with your shirt off, please put it back on. Nobody wants to land in back sweat on the pads where you recently fell.Their gym is obviously not as big as a regular gym, but it gets the job done. They have cardio equipment, barbells, a full set of dumbells to improvise anything they don't have, and boards/bars to help improve your grip. They also have rubber bumper plates for explosive workouts like power cleans. There's climbing rope and rings that hang from the ceiling. Their locker room has a good amount of lockers, 4 showers and a sauna.

I haven't been climbing since Outdoor Ed in elementary school (so pretty much since never) and was curious to see what it'd be like over ten years later and a few feet taller. Since there was a special event the place was PACKED and a little intimidating with all the hoards of people standing around. But you know, I ain't no b__ch, so I put on my game face and carried on. It was a sweet deal because members can bring a friend for free on the first Friday of every month, so I only had to pay $6 to rent a harness and shoes! Regularly it's $19 just to drop in. I was impressed by how large the facility is and how many different colorful routes of varying difficulties you can take to reach the top. My friend and his climbing buddies taught me the basics of bouldering and then decided to throw me onto my first route even though I had no idea what I was doing, plus while looking at the wall I remembered that I'm afraid of heights. I made it to the top of the wall however, then realized they didn't explain how to GET BACK DOWN. It's a little difficult to trust the idea of letting go of the wall when you already have a fear of falling but the nice guy climbing right next to me was able to explain it. I noticed nearly everyone who climbs is more than willing to help a homie out which made the experience even better. Because there was an event going on that night I was able to watch a climbing competition, grab a slice of pizza, chop it up with some Red Bull girls, participate in a raffle, and get a free t-shirt. COME UPPP. Overall PG is like a giant playground for adults and kids alike. Tons of boys competing with each other and bouncing off the walls and falling everywhere on the cushy mats. Girls doing the same but less recklessly. Three routes later and a few attempts to boulder, my delicate fingers couldn't handle it anymore but I am now convinced that I need a membership in my life in the near future.", "date": "4/9/2012"}

The girl told me that he could just climb any wall and I should stay with him and help him etc. So, $16 later, off we went. No special kids area, no help from any staff, and quite frankly, no room for any child for their first time.We managed to find one small spot for him to try, but it was way too advanced. He tried to reach a handhold, and couldn't do it. I helped, but to no avail. So, we walked around together looking for a spot for him to climb. I got told rather tersely by two climbers that we should be \"careful\". Really? Careful? I didn't let my son go out of my arms reach, and I am well aware that people are above and pointed it out several times to my son. So these childless people think we parents are so stupid we are going to risk our childrens lives and let them walk under people who could fall? There was no rhyme or reason for this \"advice\" from these people... they clearly could tell we were trying to scope everything out and they could actually have been helpful. But no, they just wanted to tell me something that was pretty obvious to any parent.Anyway, my son started to get super-upset. People were being mean and \u00a0unhelpful, there was nowhere for him to climb. it was too hard, etc etc. Not a great first experience for him and I was livid because I called to check in advance! If I had known it would be this bad, there is no way I would have put him through it.After persevering for another 10 minutes, the final straw came when a guy who was only 1 feet off the ground (he probably thought he was super manly and really high on the wall!!) yelled \"give me some space\". We would have needed to go outside to give him any more space because we were already about 6 feet away. It became obvious kids were NOT welcome here and the only support they had for children were the rental shoes...I would strongly recommend you save your money and take your child somewhere friendlier or go outside to learn climbing. We got no help anyway, so we would have been better off outdoors!!! I was so annoyed when I left, I ended up give the guy at the desk a long rant to let him know how upset I was and how they could have been more helpful on the phone and told me the gym was full of snobs!I'll never go here again.

I was excited to go rock climbing. The only problem was that they all signed up for a yoga class. I certainly couldn't climb without anyone belaying for me. So, I decided to try yoga for the first time. After 1 hour and 15 minutes, I realized I should have done yoga in some type of a tub. I was sweating like a pig! Wait I AM a pig, so I was just sweating like myself. This is one impressive gym. It has a class room inside for yoga, cardio stations and weight stations. It also has all kinds of rock climbing walls and boulders. I wish our gyms in NJ are half as nice. The prices are very reasonable. If you go in the morning, you can get in for 13 bucks.

I try to hit up PG 2-3 times a week if I can for a good climbing workout, but let me tell you -- it gets crowded with a capital \"CROWDED\" if you go during peak hours around 6-9 PM. Parking becomes pretty scarce and it might be difficult to even find problems that are open during some days. If you're lucky enough to be able to beat this rush or go early in the mornings (I recommend Saturday when it opens - you'll practically have the whole place to yourself!) then I say go work out then. PG also offers other things besides climbing. Good old stationary bikes, treadmills, stair steppers, rowing machines, weight machines and more sit alongside an open stretching area and a Crossfit area. There are also 2 rooms that offer classes such as yoga, cycling, abs and kickboxing. I've tried the Vinyasa flow and kickboxing classes and they KICKED. MY. BUTT. I was out of commission for a good week after taking those. Not for the faint of heart. Even my guy friends who took the kickboxing with me were completely annihilated by it haha. 4 stars for a great place to be and a whole lot of options for everyone! Bouldering in and of itself is a very social activity --it's very easy to bond while standing around waiting for other climbers to finish up problems.

Last month I found myself practically living in the Bay Area, with no outdoor climbing in sight. So when Gregg told me that I needed to climb at Planet Granite, I obliged. Gregg has owned and designed nearly all of the top 10 gyms in the country... so I knew he wouldn't steer me wrong, but when I walked into PG, I was just floored. I practically declared my undying love right on the spot without having climbed a single route. For starters, the wall height is one of the great distinguishing features. The only other gym I've ever been in that even comes close is Carabiners in Massachusetts. The gym was apparently designed from the ground up and features abundant space for hundreds of routes (although on a crowded weeknight, you definitely get traffic jams on every convergence point on the walls). The ratings are sugar-bagged and nearly all holds below 10D's are super juggy, but who couldn't use a little encouragement? And there are yoga classes, a full gym and outdoor bouldering - seriously?? Beat that Boston, Seattle, San Diego, Austin, Houston and Philly! I'm sooo in love it's not even funny - but not enough to want to move to the Bay (much to the chagrin of my employer) - outdoor climbing will always be better in So.

The climbing part was fun enough, but on the weekend there are a lot of people with kids on the easy wall, so it's not the best time to climb at all. The secret cave running under that wall is a hit, so plusses to PG for putting that in. For families with the under four set, I can barely recommend PG. Kids who love to climb can try bouldering on the easy verticals, but there are zero options for toddlers and crawlies who could really benefit from just climbing over hills and ramps in a toddlerspace or dedicated tiny climbers space. Go to another place, you say. Well, the idea is to do a whole family outing here. PG is a much better place for those families with kids 4-5+ who are independent climbers and players. Also, this place is BUSY on rainy days. Be prepared to wait if there are lots of kids climbing in one area. The gym smell is also really noticeable. No lockers, only cubbies.

Normally a good anchor with two bolts, two chains, and two carabiners (opposed), but here, there was a big \"hook\". Probably this \"hook\" is super safe, but it's a ONE point of failure. To protect my life I want the safest piece of equipment, and I want to be as close as to 100% safe as possible, which brings me to the second point here.2.-The top rope \"hook\" was opened, in the sense that a weird movement on the rope may get it out of the hook. Maybe I saw it wrong (hope so), and probably the kind of weird movement of the rope is very improbable, but even if this is adding just a 1% down in my safety, I will rather have something better.3.-Having been around the globe, I found quite weird that they force you to use the Grigri when belaying... There's a lot bunch of people that doesn't use grigri, even when probably they provide better security, but this is something that many people find debatable.4.-When it comes to bouldering, most of the problems lacked the \"puzzle\" part of bouldering, meaning that the \"how to solve them\" was quite obvious, but the level was set by the strength needed to climb that problem. I have to admit I found a couple of puzzle ones, very funny to climb, but most of them were about power and finger strength, specially finger strength.I will definitely try another climbing gym next time I'm in San Jose, and if I would live here I probably will come again, but this gym is no where close to my top ten places to climb indoor.", "date": "9/29/2013"}

Anyway, I'm very happy with Planet Granite. \u00a0The parking is plenty, the routes bountiful and varied, the bouldering problems challenging, the staff friendly, and the facilities clean. \u00a0It does get quite crowded between 6pm and 9pm on weekdays when everyone gets off work, but there's usually always a route somewhere that's open and of the appropriate skill level. \u00a0They have a good number of treadmills and other cardio machines, as well as weight lifting machines. \u00a0They offer more classes than just the climbing ones, as well as short series of lessons for children to learn to climb. In addition, all of the Planet Granites (this one, Belmont, and San Francisco) host events like the Friction Series (a climbing competition) and specials for certain holidays (like headlamp climbing in the dark for Halloween). The only thing I wish Planet Granite would change is their guest pass policy. Currently, members receive one guest pass every two months and they do not accrue, which seems rather petty.Still, though, I love this place.", "date": "4/4/2010"}

This past Wed, I finally got my back and fears in check. \u00a0Armed with a free pass and some stretchy pants, I was ready to experience this exhilarating and challenging sport. Naturally I am fearful of heights and most rock walls at PG are about 30ft tall. \u00a0Lucky me. You can imagine where I am going with this right...yah. \u00a0I have never climbed and am scared of heights. Am I crazy? Sure.Arrived around 5 to meet up with a pal. Rented shoes for $4, got a harness(funky contraption, but the lifeline) and immediately noticed the FUNK. \u00a0The funk that was a smell of nasty toe and sweaty shoe. \u00a0You get used to it after a while, but that first whiff is priceless. \u00a0If you go, you do need to sign up for the intro belay class, to know what you are doing. \u00a0If not, go with a PG member and get hooked up with a pass! \u00a0Price are on website.Started on the baby wall of 5.3(the difficulty goes up). Was laughing my tush off, cause a 6 year old passed me on a similar climb. \u00a0When I looked down, I immediately felt this rush of crazy go through my arms and legs. It was awesome. I figured that the middle would be a great place to let go, to see what \"falling\" would be like. It took me a while, but I did. WEEEEEE. Crazy and fun for sure. I managed to evoke my American Gladiator and get to the top. I was looking for the bell and storm, but no such luck. \u00a0Did 2 and 1/2 climbs and got as high to 5 .6. \u00a0I tried my hands at bouldering-no harness and smaller walls. Definitely more challenging, and LADIES, if you want to see the HOT GUYS, this is where it's at. \u00a0But...the boys that come here are not about picking up chicks, and be advised, they are here to climb. Complete with weight equipment, yoga studio, and cardio machines, this is a great gym. \u00a0A little pricey at $70 or so a month, but if you like this kinda stuff....definitely worth it. \u00a0 Healthy approved, and healthy endorsed!", "date": "2/13/2009"}

We tried everything from hang gliding to sky diving and everything else in between but all of these hobbies are expensive and not something we can just pick up and do one afternoon without too much planning. And then enters Rock Climbing into our lives. We heard a lot of great things with Planet Granite and with this gym being near both of our jobs, it was the perfect place to get involved in our new hobby but most importantly...together! I am really impressed with this facility and even more happy that with my membership I get a lot more then just rock climbing. I get yoga classes, cycling classes, boot camps and a full gym with cardio machines, weights and a ton of other machines and a great sauna facility with a locker room with that \"spa\" feel. Also they offer a ton of classes at all different times so their schedule works well for me....not the other way around. The price was a lot more reasonable then I thought it would be! We got lucky and only had to pay $35 for the one time registration fee and for the both of us it will be $110 a month. Plus equipment like shoes and harnesses will cost us less then $100...so it's an affordable hobby. PG also sells equipment packages with everything you need including shoes for about $130 after tax. The staff here is friendly and knowledgeable. We had our first belay lesson and we caught on easily and our instructor was very patient with us considering the group we were put in had 3 small children. This is a family friendly place and kids are welcome. Its pretty amazing to see a 4 year old climbing up a tall wall and looking like a pro! I also saw some new parents with their baby in a stroller next to the wall they were climbing. It wasn't in the way or a deterrence to other climbers so its a great place for parents to come to without hiring a babysitter. Of course all in moderation...the next thing I hate to see is a bunch of unruly unsupervised kids running around like crazy! ;) And another great thing about this gym is that draws a lot of people....I ran into 3 friends there today! If you are a single climber, you probably will have an easy time finding a stranger (and maybe new friend!) to belay your climb. This is the only drawback and why I only give it 4 stars is because it's not really a place you can use without a permanent partner to go with or you just have to make new friends fast. ;) See you on the 5.10+......okay maybe not yet....but one day!", "date": "5/3/2009"}

People are friendly and are open with helping each other out on different routes. \u00a0Furthermore, the gym is really good about making announcements for people who are looking for a belay partner and has a outdoor climbing area.And Yeah ...

There are two lessons the evening we went, if you do decide to take the lesson, I would advise to take the earliest lesson you can so that you can belay and climb for the rest of that day. Because, once you get going, you just don't want to stop. Plus it's always fun to go with a small group of friends. The lessons are always a group of 4, so having a group at least that size would be ideal.The staff at this location are very friendly and easy going. Our Belay instructor was very cool. He was very knowledgeable and was very thorough about his explanations of belaying. NOTE for more experienced climbers: you have to take their Belay Test before you can belay in their gym.After taking the Belay Lesson my boyfriend and each purchased a 5 day pass, so that we can come back a few more times to get more of a feel of the gym. We enjoyed it our first time and are excited about returning. Since we purchased the 5 day pass after our lesson, if later we decide we would like to purchase a gym membership, they put the $50 we spent on the pass toward the membership. Which saves us lots of money and gives us the option to try the gym out before we commit to a membership.If you want to try climbing and don't know where to begin, I would suggest coming to PG and taking a Belay Lesson so that way you can experience climbing as well as be eligible to take the Belay Test if you do decide to return.", "date": "2/17/2009"}

Each route has the initials of the person who created it, so you'll start to learn who creates the harder routes. ;) My one tiny complaint is that if you aren't a super avid climber and don't own all the gear, you have to pay $5 to rent the gear each time.

Then after, I went climbing! The next day was very very unpleasant for me.And um, in case anyone is wondering ... the scenery is pretty good there.

So often that if you face a hard problem, you know you gotta bust your butt to solve it in a week or two, or else it'll be gone, replaced by something else, and always an open question, were you really good enough? So work hard and never stop. This variety is a great thing. It helps motivate you to climb often, and the interesting sections (like the back chimney in the ice box) get changed up enough that they remain fun.2) They upgraded their gym equipment. Lots of free weights and now many machines that you can use alone (bench press with rails so no need for a spot, etc.). It's a pleasure to use the gym and although it's not that big, it's also not that full. They added some ropes, some hanging \"monkey\" bars or whatever they are now called as adults, and a whole set up for the training classes they run.3) They have a good slab wall which I find (I'm pretty new and not that good) to be very useful to practice the balance climbs and technique even when my arm strength has given out.4) Nice! Everyone is very nice at the gym. It's so much fun to go to.5) I haven't taken any classes here but I know a few folks, men and women, who do yoga here and say it is very good. Their classes are 90 minutes long, which I'm told by many is a great length for a yoga class (included in membership no extra cost).", "date": "1/3/2008"}

The exercise gym is never crowded and has some great machines that aren't at other gyms I've been too.

Definitely a great experience from first call to final invoice. Five stars for the management.Once we got there for our 3-5pm event, I was a little slack-jawed. The place is enormous, with dozens of faces for climbing and bouldering. There were easily another 20 people there while our 20-person group was climbing. Were I to do it again, I'd skip the 'team building' section they offer, since it ate up time and was a bit cheesy to boot (human chain unraveling and something else I can't even describe akin to Handshake Mafia).However, once we got climbing, I thought the trip was worthwhile. Our 20-person group was broken up into 3 smaller ones, and we each headed to a different piece of the rock wall. My only regret is that our mini-group headed to the other end of the gym, so we didn't get to cheer on our other teammates. We got a very nuts-and-bolts walkthrough of harnesses, knots and carabiners by Zeke, our instructor, and afterwards, all 7 of us got to climb and belay at least once. It wasn't much more than a taste of rockclimbing, but in the time we had, it was appropriate.Props to the team, who allowed us to run over our allotted time since we started late (our error, not theirs).", "date": "12/7/2007"}

Essentially, they are right -- this gym is a bit more crowded, corporate and impersonal than some -- but the consequence of this is that the place is rich and swanky enough to make City Beach and Twisters look like third world countries to PG's United States. The chain, and especially Sunnyvale and SF gyms, has the resources available to provide a great all-around experience for climbers and fitness addicts. In terms of climbing, PG Sunnyvale offers some of the most consistent ratings I have ever seen. I find the TR ratings to be pretty inflated overall and I'm not crazy about all the routesetting in this area, but the bouldering available is amazing and utilizes a great diversity of techniques. The crowd here is full of scary-amazing climbers as well as newbies, and the diversity of routes is good, with lots of routes at every level from V0 to ridiculous slope-y overhanging 10s and 11s.The yoga and other classes available are great too. I have not had a bad experience in any class but Jill's yoga class was especially good and more strenuous than the others I've tried. They also offer crossfit, abs classes, and full body conditioning.This places loses a star for me only because it is just so crowded in the evenings and peak hours and because prices are incredibly high if you do not have membership. However during weekday work hours PG is beautifully empty, and with a membership the many resources the gym has to offer make entrance well worthwhile.", "date": "8/8/2009"}

The facility is HUGE and has a wide variety of climbs. It's been pretty busy the few times we have gone, but since the gym is so big and has so many walls you really don't have to wait. Once you go, it becomes kind of addicting. There's also an extensive workout area that seems nice with decent machines. The only problem I have with PG is the fact that it is so expensive. It's $18 for a day pass, plus another $6 for a harness and shoes. We can't make it a regular thing, which is a bummer since it's so much fun and so good for you.

I dont know much about it because I didnt take it. I do know you have to schedule at least a day ahead because spots actually get taken up. Usually they're at 6:30p and/or 7:30p. Once you do the belay class, you get a temporary belay card so you can practice on your guinea pig friends. the belay device are supposedly self-locking, not the bare-bones ATC's. you can also just walk in and take the belay test (for certification) w/o scheduling. you cannot, however, take it after you climbed earlier that day. you must take it right when you come in.certification is needed for lead climbing too.there is a pretty huge bouldering section with plenty of tough (V6 and up) routes and a good cluster of V0-V2/3 sections for newer climbers. there is a training section for exercises too between the bouldering and top-roping section. there is quite a variation in route heights for top-roping - some are fairly short (in the back, called the \"ice box\") and some are quite high (in the middle of the gym). you can boulder outside too - well padded ground with rubber chunks. there's a campus board inside and outside. actually, there are multiple campus and rungs. they have cardio machines and weights - not dinky either. there are plenty of bars to do pull ups, rings, another board, shower room, lockers... very cleanly maintained too. the front has a small gear store from shoes, crash pads, carabiners, harnesses, chalk bags, atc's, etc. i think ropes too! anyway, pg is pretty well equipped. i guess i understand why it's $18. but it's still a lot. i climb there once or twice a month with friends who are members there. sometimes there's quite a bit of traffic after work hours, but nothing that's too crazy.one thing that i see that PG does not have that city beach (my gym) has are classes for kids. maybe i am wrong, but at city beach they have programs for kids. it's pretty community-based. if you're a regular, people will know your name. PG is a bit different, catering to a larger area. but it's certainly not the only climbing gym in the south bay.", "date": "11/24/2009"}

For inexperienced climbers, there is plenty of beginner terrain in both the bouldering and top rope areas as well as classes on climbing basics, safety and belaying.

Their orientation sucketh.I've never used a \"Gri-Gri\" before for belaying and I really wanted them to show me the difference before I even started. I've been trained in my profession to get an orientation to the equipment before I even get tested on it. It's common sense. Instead, they said to read this instruction set on an I beam and wouldn't help me. Okay, I look at it, but I'm used to going to Mission Cliffs where they actually SHOW you how to do it. There was a nice member with his kid who was willing to show me, but they have a policy against it, yet the staff are not so willing to show a new gal the ropes. Literally. So how am I gonna learn what they want, which is of course the standard double figure eight knot and they also want a double fisherman's knot at the top? SHOW ME. \u00a0So finally the belay tester could see I was frustrated and finally helped me after being there for thirty minutes, trying to get one staff member to help me. Their harnesses are different too. Their harnesses to rent are cumbersome, appear well-worn and frayed. They appear sketchy at best. They are the single on the side and they have this awkward clip thing that makes a kinda g-string. Their is only a single loop to attach your whole body weight to and that seemed sketchy at best. I asked for another one, but he said they are all like that. Mission Cliffs has better rent harnesses that are doubled and there are two spots to connect the harness which is much safer. The ropes seemed over- used too. They have interesting top rope configurations and lots of tall ones and the gym is nice too. An hour later, I finally got a belay partner who was nice enough to let me be a monkey. He let me try some 5.9s which were good, but the harness, oh that damn harness. Even with the stupid piece of crap harness I did do the 5.9. The best thing about Planet Granite is the members. They are pretty chill and cool. My gripe that brought the star level down is that their orientation to new people needs work and they really need to consider raising the bar with their \"Beginner\" equipment.

That being said, Planet Granite was probably the best place I could have come to return to the activity I love so much.I mean it's really fun, it really seems to scale well (from really early beginners to really advanced climbers) and it's safe. PG supplies gri-gris for pretty much every route. So I feel much safer than trusting people with an atc. Not fool proof, but a little more forgiving :) This location is my primay location which I like a lot. It has a good mix of bouldering courses and some really interesting top rope courses. They even will open out the little outside area in the back sometimes and expand some courses there too. The staff here are really nice and they will answer any question you might have. They take their time with you and really want you to enjoy your experience. I am still a beginner but I don't feel intimidated here at all. \u00a0Sometimes this place is a little relaxed on the consistency of their rating of routes but it balances out. Sometimes I master something 1 levels higher than what I am normally comfortable with, and sometimes something 1 level lower than my norm destroys me :) I find it keeps me on my toes. They seem to change up the routes every 2 - 4 weeks as well so you can practice a route pretty well before it is moved to a different configuration.", "date": "4/24/2010"}

They have two areas for bouldering, one inside and one (remodeled) outside. I absolutely love the outdoor wall, it is so good for training! It is pretty over hanging and always has (in my opinion) the best climbs. Another perk of pg is the awesome yoga/abs classes, I have \u00a0not gone to a single abs class where I did not get my ass handed to me. Love it! They do also have an awesome fitness/work out area which also offers crossfit classes. I have never taken advantage of them so I cannot really comment on them, but everyone who takes them gets super strong. So the downsides of this place are some of the staff can be pretty cold sometimes. I am friends with the majority of the staff but there are a selected few who are very arrogant and I don't like that. It is also fairly expensive.

For the south bay, this is it for indoor rock climbing. I really dont' know any other places nearby for this kind of thing. I think there is one in Fremont but I would bet it's not as well equipped as PG. I mostly do boulders and they have tons of bouldering stuff you can do including an outdoor bouldering space, although right now it's being reconstructed. With membership, the yoga classes are free and yoga really complements your rock climbing skills. I've done yoga by video and that just doesn't cut it. It's so boring w/o the class. I pay monthly membership which is 70 bucks. It's pretty expensive I think. But I make it worth while by going often and taking advantage of everything they have to offer: bouldering, top roping, sauna, yoga classes, weight lifting. Theyre packed on weeknights, which is when I usually go as well. It seems like a lot of the young silicon valley generation come here after work. I've also gone to PG Belmont and SF. the SF one is pretty rad. The Belmont one is smaller but fun once in awhile when you get tired of the same walls in Sunnyvale.", "date": "8/20/2010"}
