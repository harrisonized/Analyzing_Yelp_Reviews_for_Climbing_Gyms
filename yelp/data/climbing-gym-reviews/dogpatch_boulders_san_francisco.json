Moving on!Pros/Story:As a Bay Area based climber--that has climbed at numerous gyms throughout California--I have to say that Dogpatch is still one of my favorite gyms to take new climbers. I have taken many people climbing for their first times to this gym and a majority of the time they really enjoy their climbing experience to the point of wanting to plan future climbs! I think a big factor as to why Dogpatch is so great for new climbers is its large size. This is definitely one of the biggest bouldering gyms around and with that comes a variety of routes and difficulties for people of all levels! While this place can get pretty packed, I typically taking new climbers during times when I know there won't be masses of people. This allows for more than enough open space and routes to teach them the basics and allow them multiple attempts. After we left my friend decided to look into climbing gyms around her school so that she can be better prepared for our next climbing trip. That was so exciting to hear especially since she was originally so scared to go bouldering!I recommend coming here for their space, variety, and hours of operation.", "date": "8/3/2018"}

We arranged an intro class because our group had several bouldering virgins.

The space: so much wall space to explore. All the problems, which is cool bouldering talk for a climbing route, are labeled by difficulty and color coded. Our group tended to gravitate to some of the V0 or V1 problems and take turns trying to conquer them. Your belongings: There is plenty of shelf space throughout the facility. The shelving is open, but the space seemed fairly safe and we didn't wander too far away from our bags. Definitely bring some water.Shoe rentals: Why do they have to stink? There doesn't seem to be a sanitation spray strong enough to wipe out the stench of sweaty socks.

Make sure you learn how to properly fall before bouldering because many of those injuries happen. There are about 12 levels and I couldn't get pass level 2 as a first timer.

My friend is normally a size 7 in shoes but ended up wearing a 9 or 9.5! The staff up front are really nice and will make sure you get the right shoe size if it's your first time there :)We went in, signed the waiver, got our shoes and chalk situated (one chalk bag is definitely enough for two beginners to share lol), and put our things in cubbies by the front!

No slack line at this location like the one in El Cerrito, but the walls were definitely enough of a challenge. Parking may be a bit of a hassle, but if you can't find street parking there is a small parking lot on the street that's behind the gym that's $6 for two hours or $16 for all day :) I think it's called Lot 87?

There's also free unlimited parking in an industrial lot the next block over on Illinois between 22nd and 23rd, although it's often full during the day.

It's kind of a love hate relationship.I was a member here for about a year after moving here from SD/LA. I've been to about 15 gyms throughout CA and this one is definitely the dirtiest. EVERY other gym I've been to has signs in the restroom telling people not to wear their climbing shoes in the restroom, except the Touchstone NorCal gyms. My friend complained about the lack of shoe signs to them last week so hopefully things change next time I go. Last time I was there, I went to wash my hands after my session. In just one minute, I saw 3 people with climbing shoes on in the restroom. I don't even want to think about how many people do that per day. The restroom isn't the cleanest place, especially when it's 7pm and the bin is overflowing with paper towels. They definitely need someone to clean out those bins and the restroom more often. Every time I go to the restroom, there are piles of trash on the floor because they just don't clean it out enough. I can go on for days about how this gym is just the dirtiest ever (and not just about the bathroom), but I think I should move on. I love how big the gym is. It's the biggest bouldering gym I've been to, especially since they just opened the expansion on the right hand side. I hate how busy the gym is though. It is fine that it is busy, but DB doesn't really teach gym etiquette to newbies. A lot of time, people just walk right under you, into your fall zone. Last time, some guy also stood and blocked a section of the wall because he wanted to do this one problem and it kind of traversed two different sections. It's fine waiting, but wait behind and find a good time to jump on the problem. It's rude to block the wall because so many people are waiting... we get that you want to climb, but so do we. He blocked an entire section by standing in front of the wall for two minutes waiting for his problem to open up and kept trying to block us from climbing until I called him out on it.I also like the setting style better at other gyms. It might be because of how large this gym is, but I feel like it is kind of uninspired and all recycled sets from before.Touchstone in general is awesome, but I have so much gripes about this gym that I stopped my membership here a few months ago.** Also, I realized that I know of 4 people who have had their back windows smashed when they were parked behind the gym.

Going at in with a headful of steam, and then stepping back and thinking what was the best path and what was the best strategy. Granted, my technique and form were awful, but most importantly, I knew how to fall and get down with very low risk of actually getting hurt.As silly as it sounds, I felt accomplished doing the beginner climbs. It was a similar feeling to that of a skateboarder who had just landed a trick they had been trying all day. I gave knucks to my buddy who came with me, and I was amped for the next challenge. Even watching other people succeed and reach the \"finish line\" of their climbs was in an odd way motivating and fulfilling. The inverted walls were a lot harder than it seemed, and it was one of the last climbs that I left on. It gave me a sense of motivation for my next visit (whenever that is), and got me excited again.

I've been bouldering twice before Dogpatch, and I'm so glad I did because I would be so intimidated here. Everyone seemed to be a regular and were at a v6 or higher, I never saw anyone else at a v0 or v1. The v0s that I was trying felt like more like a v1 or v2 than a v0. Even my experienced friend said that the v0s and v1s are more difficult here than at other climbing gyms. Dogpatch seems to be a great climbing gym for experienced climbers, especially since the walls are endless. This place is huge, I don't think anyone could get bored of the routes since there are so many to try. Dogpatch is on the pricier side at $25 for a day pass, and $20 before 3pm only on weekdays. I was here for 3 hours and wasn't even able to try all the v0s because this place is so large and spacious! I had a great time, but probably wouldn't come here again b/c it's not beginner friendly and it's pricier than average.

The daily rate for climbing and rentals came to $50 for me and my bf and since we were only able to climb an hour (his hands were much worse than mine because of the coarse stones), we didn't think the experience was worth the cost. Hopefully DB will consider using stones / grabber things that are not so coarse.

You can essentially top out on 80% of the walls. And it's scary AF LOL. Topping out on these walls is extra terrifying because the walls are so high and oddly shaped and slabby and man, be careful or just down climb LOL. There's really a wall for every climber here. Tons of high balls and roofs and painfully angled walls -- you name it, they got it. Because there's so many walls and problems, there's a ton of diversity in terms of how the routes are set. Every time I've been there though, there's been a major lack of crimps; mostly jugs, slippers, pinches. I love crimps so I would enjoy more of those routes but also maybe I'm just missing all he crimpy routes because there's literally hundreds to have a go at and I probably just didn't see them.

Maybe I'm so used to the route setters in my home gym (Hollywood Boulders in LA, and sometimes Cliffs of Id in Culver City), but I didn't feel like anything was well-planned or even very fun, and I tried pretty much every wall, every route up to and including V4.A big miss is that every single hold is greasy and grimy and generally not-cared-for, and no I'm not using that as an excuse for whether or not I could send my routes. Gyms should be power washing holds at every reset, and replacing them as often as necessary - and it seems like not a single hold has been cleaned or otherwise maintained since this gym opened. I saw some guy vacuuming with a hose on one of the low top out areas but dude, that doesn't really help the real issue.Locker room was covered in chalk and dirt as well.

Also, its ratings are the closest I've ever seen an indoor gym come to matching outdoor ratings - as in it rates harder than any other gym I've been to.

There's a small area in the back with one rack and some weights, also some treadmills in the front, but no real gym. They did open a yoga room recently though, and have more unfilled space which I'm hoping they'll turn into a full-blown gym soon.- Too crowded on certain weekday nights, particularly Tuesday nights. They're open later on Tues/Thurs, so that might be the reason.- Parking is shady. Do not leave shit in view or you WILL get a broken window.Aside from those things though, this gym is great.

It was really cool to see grown adults taking advice from some really cool kids!I will definitely be making my way back here, hopefully on a somewhat regular basis. My only reserve is that I need to figure out how to stretch so that my forearms aren't dead when I wake up the next day!", "date": "9/11/2016"}

There is also a 20 foot tube slide that my daughter literally slid down 20 times. There is kind of a high ladder to climb up which made her nervous initially. But with some coaching, she made it to the top and was rewarded for her efforts with the fun slide. Climbing up to the slide multiple times helped her to overcome some of her fear of heights. Which, in turn, helped her to feel more confident on the kiddie climbing walls. She would rotate between the slide and the climbing walls. She even practiced the correct way to fall. Every so often I would find her curled up onto her back with a big smile on her face. Way to fall correctly, sweetie. Another major benefit of having a dedicated kids area is that I didn't have to be afraid of larger humans falling on her. The adult bouldering area was cool too. There is nothing like it.

For me personally, I don't use at least half of the gym. But it feels luxurious to be so choosy! The setting is pretty solid. It can be a little height dependent, but that affects pretty much only me. If you're tall and on the slab, yes Adam T., you're right. The rating will feel easy. If you're short you might struggle. Such is life. The holds can be slick, but that's par for the course. They could use a bigger steep cave lower to the ground. I want to climb parallel to the ground for 20 moves. There's nowhere to do that, not even if you're traversing. They have a lot of overhanging walls at about 15 feet, but that's not what I'm about. The gym in general is awesome.

If it were closer or more BART friendly, I'd be sold! Nevertheless, I forsee a lot of afternoons to be spent gettin pumped on these walls. Love this gym!!", "date": "3/25/2013"}

This is as good as bouldering gets without being outside. When the gym opens, there should be over 300 problems set by the same crew that does all of the Touchstone routesetting. If you like bouldering at a Touchstone gym, you'll love bouldering here.One difference in the setting style here is the lack of a finishing designation at the top of the wall. Instead of a tape marking where to place your hand to finish the problem, it is expected that the climber just grab the top anywhere. Perhaps with the greater height, they didn't want to put riskier moves at the end.The walls are high. Taking a fall from 18 feet up can be a little hard to get used to. The 14 inches of foam with seamlessly stitched tarp over it lessens the blow enough to prevent injury, but it still isn't the most pleasant feeling.Besides the amazing terrain, what this gym has over all other Touchstone gyms is two sections with top-outs(!), a center arch (was sadly not climbable during the member preview), and a smaller back wall. Planet Granite just lost its big selling point for me.In my opinion this is the best climbing gym in the Bay Area. For roped climbing I'll obviously be sticking around Mission Cliffs, but Dogpatch is my new go to for bouldering.", "date": "2/13/2013"}

At Mission Cliffs, you have to know how to tie knots, secure your harness, belay people etc. Here, there are no harnesses. The walls are quite high IMHO so if you fall and don't fall properly, I could see it being a bit dangerous. I personally find it really fun though if you take your time and know your limits and don't push yourself into a situation you can't handle. It's also really interesting to watch other people \"solve problems\" and then trying to figure things out on your own as well. The levels go from V0-V8 with V0 being the easiest. However, I have found not all V0s are created equal... there are parts of the gym where you are meant to / or can climb on top of the structure and then take a ladder down.
