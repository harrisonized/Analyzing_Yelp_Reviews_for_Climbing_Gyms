With the membership, you can also bring a guest per month! Weekends are usually packed with people, and lots of children with parents from what I've seen so far so it's best to go during weekdays! There's also a sort of smell when entering... I'm guessing from the sweat and chalk and just natural ventilation from the wind, but it's not terrible that I have to plug my nose. I compare it to the odor of a gym, but with chalk mixed in. Okay, I'm making it sounds worse than it is, but it's that bad!I like that they switch up the routes every few weeks/month, it makes it less monotonous, especially for people who go quite often! Also the people who go are super friendly, and supportive in giving tips on how to master the route. It's great, love it, go try it, you won't regret it.", "date": "3/14/2019"}

I've been to the Mission Viejo location, Long Beach location, and Upland location and while this location may not be the biggest, I would say it's more beginner friendly and great for bouldering. They change up the routes every Wednesday which keeps things interesting. However, if you're looking for top-roping and auto-belays, you may be better off at the upland or long beach location. My only issue with this place is it gets ridiculously hot in the summer which quickly becomes a sauna due to the lack of ventilation going on aside from a fan in the back. \u00a0The nice thing about hangar 18 is they offer free top rope lessons/certification every hour and have some of the most friendly staff.

I figured this is a sport that takes time to develop skill and strength.

My wife and I also climb outside, weather permitting. It's important to find a convenient home gym in order to keep in shape and push your self to the next level. We moved from Long Beach to the San Gabriel Valley, and there wasn't anything out here until now. We had tried Stronghold, LA Boulders, and Hangar Upland. The first two are incredibly overpriced. It's like they think they have Sender One level gyms, and they simply don't. Hangar Upland was fine, but the drive didn't make sense for us. This gym just opened, so they're still getting things in line. They took over the old \"Arc Climbing gym\", and made it their own. It's right across the street from REI, so if you forget something, then you won't have to walk far ;)I'm sure they plan to make improvements along the way. It is mostly a bouldering gym. There are some top ropes at the entry to the gym, but the walls are only about 15-16' tall. There are 3 auto belay devices (it allows you to climb on rope without a partner). There is no lead climbing, and they don't plan to add it in the immediate future. All the holds are brand new, and the routes have a pretty good range (v0 - v7). For those in the LA area who are new to Hangar Gyms, they tend to be smaller than the \"big name\" gyms, but the level of climbing is usually great and so is the community. They have seasonal specials (and currently a grand opening special), but the regular monthly rate is only $36 a month and there is no initiation fee. We had fun, and will be back soon. \u00a0I will update my review as time passes. Update:They've made improvements! The new industrial ceiling fan is great!! All walls are now full of holds, and they're re-setting on a regular basis. The range of climbing is now v0 - v10. I think they could use at least one or two VB climbs for the beginners. The new signage on the outside looks great!Overall, I am very happy with the improvements and I hope they keep it up!", "date": "9/19/2018"}

No. I would blame the gym for not screwing in the volume tightly. But I understand that mistakes happen. But I was more upset about how the staff handled the situation. They asked once or twice if he was alright, but none of them ever said sorry for it happening. Felt like it was more of a burden for them to take care of the accident. There was also no sense of compensating him for the incident. Pretty sure my friend asked if they had water after his fall from about 6ft from a loose enough volume and they still wanted to charge him for the water. Like just give it to him!

My buddy and I went earlier today because of an awesome Groupon deal. The manager, Ari was amazing. Very friendly and knowledgeable in the art of climbing. Honestly I probably won't be climbing again, just not my thing but the manager was amazing and the facilities were great if you are looking to climb!Thanks again :)", "date": "8/26/2018"}

He used his guess pass on me so I didn't have to pay for anything which is really nice because that's a great way for people to bring their friends in to try something new. You could also upgrade from a guess pass to a membership for only $5 which is like practically free LOL. You do need to pay to rent shoes if you want them but it's only $3. I didn't upgrade cause my friend didn't tell me about it so I just came another day with another friend and we both got the one month membership for $36. I believe one day is $18 so you only need to go twice to get your money's worth haha. I've already been there four times this month and I'm planning on going a lot more.The staff is all very nice and friendly but there was this one short Asian girl with a high voice and a baby face who was a little rude when the place was about to close for the night. The way she said that we had to start leaving could have been nicer. A simple \"hey guys just to let you know there's only 30 more minutes left\" would have been fine. But the rest of the staff's kindness compensated for her.", "date": "8/14/2018"}
