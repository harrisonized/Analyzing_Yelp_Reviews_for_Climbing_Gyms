I had such a fun time and will be looking forward to going there again! My friend and I went to Mission Cliffs around 1:30pm on a Saturday afternoon. Rock climbing has become pretty trendy in the past few years, so it was no surprise to me that Mission Cliffs was super busy. Even though it was busy, we had no problem finding the space to climb the proper grade for me. I've never been to an indoor rock climbing gym to begin with, so I was super impressed by the overall facility as I had no expectations. Since Mission Cliffs spanned a whole block, essentially one whole side of the gym was the rock wall. The rock wall had areas either just for top rope climbing or lead climbing as well as areas that allowed for both. There was also a designated bouldering section at one end of the gym. I loved the small lounge area that you climb up to, where you could get a bird's eye view of the place. What I liked about Mission Cliffs was that it was a one stop shop for all around fitness. The main attraction there was, of course, the rock climbing, but Mission Cliffs has a section for weight training, a cycling room, a yoga studio, and several treadmills and cardio machines around the facility. Lastly, the check-in process was easy, and customer service was excellent. Everyone working the reception area greeted us, and Jordan, who sized my shoes and provided my harness, was the nicest guy ever.", "date": "1/13/2019"}

This morning I came from my own gym in my gym clothes heading to work a block away where I manage a start-up. Last time, maybe it was too busy at 5:15p but this morning I thought I would have a better chance to view the space before I make the decision to pay for a gym for our employees. I am just baffled at the bullshit with some of these boutique businesses in the bay. Am I too black, are they just rude & don't five a fuck or am I too fat to come and work out? Jeeezzz!

Beside being extremely patronizing, talking trash about other instructors, constantly bragging about how good she is, and inviting students to attend classes she teaches in other studios, her routines are absolute nonsense: she constantly skips poses on one side and confuses left and right, her poses sometimes escalates into advanced sequences without a proper warmup inviting injuries to happen, she does not give any time to fix form, doesn't seem to care about alignment or corrections, and instead of adapting to the pace of the class, she simply keeps barreling (and talking non stop) through her very confused sequences.

Comparing Mission Cliffs to others there isn't much they offer in terms of climbing/bouldering. First, the belay testing. It didn't seem as if there were any standards they followed. A woman before me was tested by one of the staff members and the woman being tested seemed a bit iffy on a few minor things and she seemed to pass fine due to her experience and technique. My husband and I, on the other hand, had a different staff member test us and while our belay technique, tying in, and safety checks were all fine - save for maybe forgetting the 6\" or less rule of slack, when I hardly had any slack (honestly who remembers that exact number?) - \u00a0we only received temporary cards. When questioning this member what exactly we missed they could not give us a straight answer. Just give me a solid answer rather than bumming around the issue -- \"Uhhh well we test differently than PG...\" Ok I guess? Did it look like I was putting someone in danger? Was my belay method off? So I know for next time when I come in again. I would've been less irked if they told me what exactly went wrong. On top of this both members who were testing did not even ask us or others what the safety commands were when tied in or belaying.I understand not giving a permanent belay card to someone who clearly does not know what they're doing for safety reasons but as someone who has been climbing for 4 years indoors and outdoors and felt that my checks and technique were competent enough (and received praising responses from said member who tested us) I seriously couldn't understand why. Routes: it seems like MC has very soft/inflated ratings. I understand routes are at the discretion of the setters but climbing a 5.9 to warm up felt like a 5.6/5.7 with no variation (climbing up a ladder as another user pointed out). Climbing at Planet Granite (all three in SF, Sunnyvale, and Belmont), Dog Patch Boulders, and others outside of SF they felt consistent except for here. On top of the routes they hardly have anything less than 5.10a. Every single wall in MC is rated 5.10a or higher; at least this was on the day I went in, I don't know how it is when they switch up the routes. I counted maybe only 5 or so routes rated lower ranging 5.6-5.9. Where are people supposed to warm up? Stand in line on those so few routes and wait? What about people who are not yet ready to go to higher ratings? The soft ratings could also be in part of this, so while you feel like you're climbing 5.10a and above you're actually climbing 5.8 or so....In addition to that there were routes where it felt like people would be climbing/descending on top of each other. And there were tons of people standing around getting in the way of climbers. I hardly saw any staff members walk the floor to check on people and their technique/safety. This is pretty standard at any gym I've climbed at. I wanted to point this out because I saw a few people being sloppy. There were two people who were on a route and the person climbing the route had his phone out face timing someone! This dude straight up had his phone out and low and behold, he slipped (from halfway up the route) and ended up swinging hard/whipping and getting himself and his belay partner tied up with the people next to him. Grossly incompetent and someone could've been hurt had he swung into someone. I seriously wanted to go up to these guys and tell them how stupid they were being by doing that.Overall I don't know if I'll be back. We were really looking forward to finally coming here because my husband and I live close and it's more convenient than going all the way to PG. Who knows what will happen and the \"luck\" we will receive when taking our belay test again; if we ever return. Waste of $50.", "date": "7/20/2017"}

Not sure if it's cuz I learned how to climb somewhere else or what cuz I definitely haven't gotten the figure 8 knot wrong or forgotten any safety checks either...they don't tell me why they won't give me a normal belay card, I've asked lol. Maybe because I don't climb there regularly (I'm more of a boulderer)? Idk. The belay test takes like 5-10 minutes so it's not a huge hassle to take it before climbing. It does get pretty darn crowded in the rope area though. But good range of climbs and there are a lot of interesting problems. Not a big fan of the bouldering area though. It's small and cramped.

First impression was this place is definitely smaller than Planet Granite in the Marina. They have a wall worth of climbing routes mostly consisting of 5.10a and higher routes. I felt like they had more routes for professionals, which makes sense, but if you are coming here as a beginner/intermediate there are limited routes. I also felt like some of their rankings were a little off - I climbed a 5.9 that seemed more like a 5.7 or 5.8. I personally enjoyed their bouldering section more. The routes varied a lot and were really fun to climb. The only complaint I have is that it can get a little crowded and stuffy since it's on the second floor and with the curves of the wall - it leaves little room for multiple people to climb at once. \u00a0Other amenities in their facility includes:- cycling room- free weights, machines, squat racks and benching - very clean bathroom with lockers and showers Overall, I see myself coming here maybe once or two more time to try the routes I didn't climb the first time.", "date": "8/19/2016"}

The staff has been rude, belittling, and extremely inattentive. My first gripe is with the complete lack of organization or consistency around belay testing. I climb frequently at a variety of gyms wherever my travels take me. Belay tests are expected and I've never had an issue at any other gym where I've taken the test. I went to Mission Cliffs several times and was never asked to take a belay test. One day my girlfriend was in town and joined me. Even though it was her first time at the gym, they still didn't mention any safety requirements or a belay test. We started climbing, and about 30 minutes in a staff member approached us with a very aggressive tone about our lack of \"belay certified\" tags. His tone was so aggressive and off-putting that we decided to stop climbing altogether to stymie our interaction with him.Our next visit, he was the person who checked us in and upon recognizing us stated he remembered our interaction and comp'd us our rental shoes and harness. The rental harness clip configuration was different than the one I own, so before the belay test started, I asked my examiner how to close the clip (make a \"c\" instead of an \"o\"). At the end of the test she said I \"did extremely well\" and asked where I typically climb - then proceeded to give me a partial pass because the clip wasn't closed before my inquisition. Ridiculous. I wasn't planning to climb before asking about the configuration of the rental harness. During the next visit's belay test I was asked how many pairs of 2's to check for. Having never been asked this before, I began to count aloud. After getting to three I started to count in my head and before I finished counting my examiner interjected the appropriate number and stated I was wrong that it was not in fact three. Then she asked if I was tied in to the wrong side of the rope, which I was not, but she led me to believe I was. At this point we decided to end our visit and don't expect to return unless an earthquake moves their facility to be the only cliff of refuge outside my apartment building during the apocalypse.There appears to be no protocol for the belay test or when/if it should even be performed at Mission Cliffs. A huge miss for a test that is supposed to improve safety.The rest of my gripes are about general rudeness and inattentiveness of the staff. Every time I need help with something (e.g. getting a different sized pair of shoes or asking a question about the harness configuration) they take an extremely long time to respond even though they aren't attending to other customers. I'll finish off by saying that I just raised an investment round and i found my experience at Mission Cliffs more demoralizing than getting rejected by VC's.", "date": "12/10/2016"}

I regularly go to MC, GWPC & BIW, with a few visits to Diablo around the holidays (because they have the best holiday hours).MC renovations are still in progress -- and if you dislike crowds, I recommend you avoid visiting here in the \"after work\" hours -- it gets pretty packed.Music-wise, they have a better pulse on the Pandora station than other gyms, and even play their own play lists. \u00a0As with other Touchstone gyms -- things are a bit grungy and dirty all around: \u00a0holds are usually dirty, walls are usually dirty, bathrooms and inside lockers are usually not so great (on par with the other gyms; though Diablo seems to have the CLEANEST bathroom/locker room of all I have visited).Customer service is hit or miss -- there's an ethic to hospitality & customer service that is sorely lacking in the Bay Area. \u00a0It's beyond the response of \"no problem\" or \"it's alright\" to a \"thank you\" (seriously - why not say \"you are welcome\" or \"my pleasure\", folks?). \u00a0People really do pick and choose what parts of customer service they think are important and ignore the rest -- the customer is not always right here, and the folks who work in service roles prefer to think of themselves as \"equals\" to their customers from whom they are taking money (and giving what - exactly - in return?). \u00a0 \u00a0Of course all INDIVIDUALS are equals -- but when you voluntarily take a job (getting paid) to provide service to people -- it seems you would not be indifferent, snarky, sarcastic or apathetic about it. \u00a0When you are in an transactive relationship - there is no equality to the role.My point is - any complaints of customer service issues should be taken up at the gym, very close to the time of the incident and with specific details about what was inappropriate or offensive -- that's really the only way to change the culture of poor customer service. \u00a0It's not specific to Mission Cliffs (as many folks might claim in their Yelp reviews) -- but to individuals and their training or aptitude for *serving* others.", "date": "1/8/2015"}

I've only been rock climbing twice at Planet Granite. The only downside to Planet Granite is that it's really far. Mission Cliffs is much more easily accessible although they close an hour earlier than Planet Granite does.The price for belay lessons was $30. It was stated on the website that it was recommended to call in to reserve spots if a party of four or more wanted to take the lesson so I called in but they told me to just walk in and it was first come first serve. I think if we had one more person in the group it would have been different. It was stated that it would take about an hour but it lasted for an hour and a half. I think it's because our group was kind of big (four including myself plus two other people) and the instructor probably wanted to make sure we really knew what we were doing.The belay lessons here were more detailed and the instructor we had took the time to test us individually several times which is something I appreciate although I did get antsy really fast. She was very helpful though.By the time we were allowed to climb on our own, we got tired out kind of fast. Rock climbing takes a lot of forearm strength. I didn't expect it as much in the roped rock climbing because I\"ve never felt that much strain on my forearms from belaying at Planet Granite...but I did work forreal.

A couple of things that are not meeting expectation:1. The route setting here is mediocre. There are interesting routes here too but lots of the 5.10 something are not really well thought of. Among all the gyms I've been to, the overall quality of this gyms' routes is the worst. 2. The 5.10s (and below) here are very very soft. I guess it's a \"feel good\" gym for beginner climbers. There are some interesting routes around 5.11 and 5.12, but the rating between different routes are very very inconsistent. I know ratings are subjective and it can't always be accurate, but some of the ratings here are so off. 3. There isn't a good climbing training area. This gym is so spacious yet they don't have a nice training area for finger boards and rungs, they have a huge yoga room and lots of treadmills, but c'mon, as a climbing gym it really should have a very nice area for climbing specific trainings. 4. They are very short staffed. They don't have staff member to give lead belay tests during weekday nights.5. They don't have the compensating weight for lead climbers, which makes it not safe for some climbers. All the other gyms I've been to either have the compensating weight, or have something for the belayer to tie into at the bottom of each lead route. As a very light weight climber, I always belay someone much heavier than me, and very often need the compensating weight. But once I was lead climbing in this gym, I was about to belay someone over 40 lbs heavier than me, I asked if they have the weight they just told me they don't and told me \"you're fine\"...it really irresponsible. I know perfectly how to catch a heavier climber, but the weight difference just means that they'll fall longer and there's nothing I can do. Stop giving excuses for not having enough safety equipments!6. Some of the staffs here are very rude. They are not just \"not friendly\", they are rude. They don't respect the members here, I don't want to talk about specific examples... In all the other gyms I've been to, the staffs were nice and helpful, they really help to build a great climbing community around their gyms. But that's not the case here, here it feels like the staffs are working against the members. To them this is purely a job, which is understandable but not good. 7. I've been climbing for a couple of years in multiple gyms, never had a hold fell off from the wall before. Yet it happened in this gym and I've only been there less than 10 times. Time to wear a helmet indoors..I got a membership before knowing all these nuances, now I'm very disappointed at this gym. It's just sad that they are in such a great location yet they are so bad.PS. I emailed the gym about one incident when a staff member was very rude to me, and did not get a response from the gym. That just tell me that they don't respect their customers, they stand behind the bad behavior of their employees. That being said, I didn't take it personal, cuz I think that staff member is just rude to people in general.I wish one day I can leave a review saying \"they have the best routes I've tried in any gym, they have the best climbing training area and their staffs go out of their ways to help the climbers in the gym\".

Mission Cliffs, compared to gyms in other cities, or hell, even within the city, is a joke. Here's why:- Routes are highly inflated by a grade or two, maybe even three; you'll be in for a shock if you do any outdoor climbing, or even visit another gym. Nearby Planet Granite is closer to grading elsewhere, and even PG is a little overrated. - Routes graded 5.10D and above are inconsistent and unpredictable. Their setters are all over the place. A 5.10d will be as hard as a 5.11c; a 5.11a will be incredibly easy one week, impossible the next, and so on. It's hard to track your progress with such variability. - Routes are set densely and incredibly close to each other, leading to a lot of congestion. In some cases, this congestion is dangerous -- in the rooms where there are overhangs with steep leanbacks, I've seen climbers fall back and literally smash into each other in the air. - The weight room portion of the gym is poorly laid out and incredibly crowded, almost to the point of being unsafe. For example: although there are a ton of pull-up bars in the area, they are often always on top of weight racks. A person can't do pull-ups if there's somebody there lifting weights -- and believe me, there's always somebody there lifting weights. The equipment is terrible; weights are rusted, metal. Good luck if you're trying to do anything other than a bicep curl -- there's no space for real weightlifting moves like deadlifts and cleans.- The \"new\" part of the gym, despite being new, is a hot mess. The carpet wasn't bolted down properly and bunches up all over the place, causing lots of people to trip. Although construction was only finished a few years ago, it was so poorly done that you can't actually tell that it's newer than the rest of the gym. It's already dirty as sin.- Everything is filthy. This is legitimately a breeding ground for MRSA.- People here are INCREDIBLY rude, staff and patrons alike. Because it's always insanely crowded, everybody just fends for themselves. The more advanced people will cut you in line for routes, or in some cases, even snake your route by tying on to the rope next door and climbing the route your rope is meant for. Tech noobs and amateurs will crowd around easy routes, spending 15-20 minutes tied in but NOT climbing, instead looking up and \"analyzing\" the climb, leading to even more congestion and crowding.So why do I still go? Unfortunately, I've been climbing for years now and this is the closest gym to me. Do I like it? No. Do I feel safe? No, not really.Hm. Maybe time to suck it up and just ride out to Planet Granite.", "date": "7/15/2015"}

It might be the marina in me, but I wasn't super impressed. The gym definitely has a mission feel... a bit on the dirty side, old ropes and no modern conveniences such as gri gris. Bring your own ATC or you won't be climbing. Also be prepared to spend 10 minutes waiting for and then filling out a digital waiver on outdated computer systems which slow the whole process.I was also surprised by how uptight the clientele seemed to be. Everyone was SUPER sensitive about even the slightest route overlap, even if the climber on the wall was already pretty far up the route. A bit hyper I think... we can all get along and share, especially in a small gym.That brings me to the size. I have to caveat this by saying they are under construction to double the size which should be great. But right now the climbing area if pretty small (though are are a good amount of ropes, just too many people who are too sensitive about overlap to be much good). The gym area is also pretty tiny. Planet Granite SF is only a bit better in this regard, but the Sunnyvale PG blows them both out of the water - a ton of climbing and gym space.The one highlight here was that the staff was very friendly and happy to help when I asked to take a belay test (another qualm... PG and Mission Cliffs should have some sort of reciprocal agreement - I'm lead qualified at PG and yet still had to take a test just to get top rope certified at MC).

The customer service is mostly appalling. With some exceptions, the desk people are uninterested in helping out, don't greet you or look you in the eye, and are often away from the desk. Case in point, one day, me: \"Do you offer personal training?\" Desk person: \"We have a personal trainer associated with us, but they're shockingly expensive.\" And then turned to walk away. That's government bureaucracy quality ofcustomer service there. Or tonight, I asked for a towel at close: \"Aw too bad!

I'd like to be treated with professional courtesy.The weight room was really small when I joined, and since construction has started, it's become even smaller, and now it's moved to a part of the gym that's real awkward. Too open to foot traffic, benches are positioned near protruding wall parts, no mirrors. It's bad and probably dangerous, and there's no indication if it will change. The bouldering area is small too and the problems frustratingly hard for a beginner like me. I guess the difficulty goes with the territory but Dogpatch and Ironworks seem to hit the sweet spot more consistently. Gym closes super early on the weekends. 7pm doesn't really cut it.Many frayed ropes on the top rope routes, and semi-frequent loose holds. Is this dangerous or just annoying? \u00a0Well that's it.

I am on a vacation to San Fran right now and I had heard about the awesome rock gyms in San Fran. I have a membership in LA and the walls are much shorter so I was really excited about climbing some huge walls. The staff was so rude I could not even believe it. They used a different belay device than I'm used to and they refused to show me how to use it. They told me to find another gym patron to show me or try to figure it out on the smaller walls. So of course I went out and bought the belay device I usually use because I had already paid my 20$ and no one was going to give it back. (Utter determination). So, I pass the test. Now my friend comes who is unfamiliar with climbing, not that I'm anywhere near an expert, and they won't show him how to put the harness on. Mind you, at this point, the front desk is not busy and the testing guy is just standing around. I have my own harness and had never see this type of rental harness before. I mean really? You could not take a few seconds to show him how to put the harness on? In the gym I climb in at home, the staff are happy to help. They care about safety and they will show people how to use the equipment because they want to ensure people are safe. They care and they are polite where I come from. Just a quick comment about the quality of the gym itself. Not impressed. The routes for the top route climbing are not very well thought out. It's basically like climbing a latter up a wall. I guess I'm used to more of a puzzle and more wall shape variation. The routes are just really boring. The bouldering routes are more fun. The place was pretty crowded but we were able to find open ropes. The etiquette of the other climbers leaves something to be desired. My guess is that this is because the staff refuses to do any teaching and also perhaps because if the staff does teach I would imagine that if their ettiequte matches their attitude then of course we have poor etiquette.I would not return here. My friend who lives in San Fran does not plan to return here. It's really too bad, I was very excited to get in there and climb.Side note: it took 2 full hours to pass the belay test and the person testing allowed my friend who had never belayed before to belay me without ever actually belaying a person before.", "date": "2/10/2016"}

One of my favorites I have been to in the US. The route-setting at Mission Cliffs is very good! The routes flow well, there are feet where they are needed, and it is apparent that short people are taken into consideration when the routes are set. I was recommended by a former setter for Touchstone Climbing (route-setters for Mission Cliffs) to visit the gym, and he did not stray me the wrong way. The only thing I could note, and this is petty, is that the grades were pretty soft, but that seems to be the trend with most new gyms. Despite the grade levels, the climbing itself was incredibly fun.Within 20 minutes of being in the gym, I had sent the hardest boulder problem they had to offer, which was a slight bummer, as I was training for a bouldering trip. When I went to the desk to ask for a belay test, so that I could continue climbing, I had mentioned that they needed more hard boulder problems (V10+), and the staff member informed me of their strictly bouldering gym (Dogpatch) a few blocks away. Instead of packing up and heading there, I took my belay test. The gym has a great feature, if you do not have a partner, they will make an announcement over the loudspeaker if anyone else was looking for a partner. I thought this was such a great concept. Within 5 minutes, I had a partner and began climbing every route that gym had to offer.I did not witness a belay lesson, but heard from some patrons that I climbed with that Mission Cliffs is very good about giving thorough belay lessons. In this new day and age of fast-paced mega gyms, it is good to hear that there are still places that understand the importance of a good safety and belay lesson.All in all, a great place to climb!", "date": "1/13/2015"}

At other gyms, I can't touch a 5.10c, but here I've been able to complete a 5.10C without stopping (and I'm more out of shape than ever). This is great for my ego, but something to keep in mind. The bouldering route ratings seem to be on par with other gyms. There also seems to be less slopers and crimps in routes. Having said that, there are very few routes under 5.10a - a trickle of 5.6 - 5.9s but not much. There's a good array of tall and shorter climbs. I've been here on what seems like their busiest times and you may have to wait for a few minutes, but if you aren't too picky you never seem to have to wait a lot. Good set of bouldering routes as well. STAFF: NEUTRAL: Staff seems ok - have had some meh experiences and some good ones.

It was the first climbing gym I ever visited, and it holds a special place in my heart. The intro to toproping class is great, and the instructors are friendly and patient. Additionally, the locker rooms here are the nicest of the three Touchstone gyms I've been to.The staff here are all pretty friendly, and most of the clientele also seem pretty chill and laid back. That said, this place gets craaazy packed after work on weekdays. It's almost unbearable. On weekends, expect smaller crowds. (I'm sure the same can be said for weekdays during the day, but I've never tested this out.)They seem to change up the routes pretty frequently here, but not too frequently so you can still conquer your projects. There's something for every difficulty level here, but the lead climbing seems to be a bit packed into tight quarters, which makes for some scary incidents every now and then.Parking is very very very rarely an issue here. Usually street parking is pretty easy to find on weekday evenings or on weekends, plus it's free! :)NB: One of the things I really like about the Touchstone gyms in general is that they double the rope at the top anchor, so there is additional friction that prevents the belayer from being lifted up from the floor. It makes for a nice gym experience, even if it isn't super reminiscent of an outdoor experience.", "date": "1/11/2014"}

That's fair; lots of places do it that way. Perhaps you can understand, then, why it burns my bristles to never have access to a locker because everyone else is cramming their crap into the units and NOT using a lock, when we all know there are only so many lockers available. Honestly, if you have a lock then just start moving the unlocked stuff out.The Hipster Ratio: These spoiled brats are claiming this place as their own, complete with the usual level of flippant privilege they expect.

Nil.Back in elementary school when those President's Physical Fitness tests were all the rage in schools - \u00a0I always failed miserably - when it came to the push-up and pull-up part. My body just wouldn't cooperate. And so those coveted President's Physical Fitness blue badges were perpetually out of reach. I always had to settle for red (which when you think about it - red is a much cooler color than blue anyways).Nowadays I've pretty much sworn off exercising - outside of walking and dancing (though I've found that messy rooms can conveniently double up as agility obstacle courses - and sharpie scribbling makes for prime arm work-out) So when I learned that we were having a small work offsite at Mission Cliffs Climbing & Fitness - I was both a little nervous and excited. Excited because climbing sounds fun. Looks fun. And because my arms could definitely benefit from some quality strength challenges. Nervous - because the idea of someone's life being in my hands - on some rope does not sound like fun. Nervous because like I said before - I have absolutely no upper body strength.Despite any initial reservations - Mission Cliffs surpassed my expectations. Mission Cliffs was not only impressive - \u00a0facility wise - but their staff rocked it. From the moment we arrived - their staff were helpful, patient, and efficient.They let us leave our stuff in the party room - and didn't object when we hungrily devoured \u00a0huge cupcakes before making our way to the ropes (sooooooooooo not a good idea)We were split into two groups. My group's instructor was amazing. She walked us through everything with extreme diligence. If we didn't understand something - she would smile and then take her time in really making sure that we were comfortable with a concept - before moving on.It was apparent from the moment she began talking - that she truly enjoyed climbing and seemed to genuinely enjoy teaching people about how to better appreciate it, as well as making sure that we were doing it as safely as possible.When it came to the actual climbing part - I \u00a0- was...well not good. My \u00a0climbing - form \u00a0- pretty much mirrored the way I dance - butt out. But I had such a great experience with the process of learning how to climb - that I'd love to come back sometime and try to conquer the climbing wall again....And maybe even try some yoga here..The great thing about Mission Cliffs is that it is not only an exceptional climbing center, but it's also a fitness center. They offer yoga classes and even host some basic exercise equipment as well.My favorite take-away from Mission Cliffs, outside of that slightly sore feeling in the arms, \u00a0is that despite the popular misconception that climbing is all about upper body strength - it isn't. It's about problem solving and keeping your body in balance to find the best angle and position possible - to allow you to work your way up a wall or incline as comfortably and confidently as possible...(at least that's what I took away from it...)Which means - there's hope for me \u00a0:)", "date": "4/6/2010"}

The automated computerised sign-up process was painless and easy (for me... less so for her) and took no more than five minutes. Then it was off to the races!I will note that even at crazy early hours, Missions Cliffs is busy. From the moment the doors opened, there were hardcore gym-goers on the stationary bikes warming up, some far more proficient climbers than I on the walls, and it got progressively more hectic as the morning wore on. I could see this place being jam packed during normal hours or on the weekends, but there was a pleasant hum of activity during the early morning.Coming back to the bouldering, you'll not want for options or challenge. I struggled with a couple of V0s and V1s over by the bikes until we realised that there was a whole section of wall strewn with easier bouldering problems tucked away in a back corner upstairs. I did witness some more experienced climbers working on some awe-inspiring climbs around the corner, and I always love ogling -- errr... I mean... admiring... -- the grace and athleticism of hardcore enthusiasts.If I lived in SF, I could totally see making this a local morning routine, especially if I lived nearby.

It's a great place to learn to climb. A year ago I had only ever rock climbed once (and that was almost 20 years ago in Tahoe). MC has lots of classes and the testing doesn't take that long. The staff is quick to get you hooked up for the day.2. Community! I see the same faces year-round, and there are some serious athletes that frequent this place (lots of pull-ups). If I see them every time I'm here, one can almost guarantee they come more often. The staff is nice too. They're very patient with the n00bs.3. Routes! There are so many routes, varying in degree. A few 5.4-5.6s and lots of 5.10s. A year into it, my climbing partner and I have reached the moderate level that allows us to climb 5.10As and 5.10Bs without climbing the same routes each week. The staff does a pretty good job of creating new routes. 4. Space to breathe. The height of this building is so tall that the bouldering walls are on the second floor.  5. Locker room. It has all the things you need: showers, saunas, open air, lockers etc. Best part, it's kept really clean! I guess that goes back to my second reason for loving this place, the community...There are a few things that could make this place better - more space to do ab workouts/stretching and the cardio machines are out-dated and often broken.

I see it as the smell of accomplishment and hard work....or sometimes it's the smell of the stale alcohol,fried food being sweated out in the form of broken dreams. Either way....I shall regurgitate my previous statement..it's a gym...it's suppose to smell.Yes, This place does tend to get a little packed...which means...it's MUY POPULAR!!!! \u00a0I like to climb every now and then, but my home is the weight room. It will get bigger during renovations and it does the job of what is needed. Being a fitness competitor, working on the body is a full-time job and I approve of the weight room. If anyone complains of it being dirty or grimy...you pry don't belong in a weight room in the first place.The prices are.....IT's SF ....DEAL....the prices aren't that bad....a monthly membership if you are a full member are 71$....pretty much the same price as the parking tickets from the previously stated above...(CAR-NAGE) rant. And you can climb at a bunch of the other gyms as well in the bay area. :-0 Really? YES!!! REALLY! I'm waiting to see what it looks like when the renovations are completely done. MISSION CLIFFS....

The treadmills and ellipticals looked fine, but the weight room area had pretty old free weights and machines. The rock walls themselves are awesome with many degrees of difficulty. I wouldn't call the gym immaculately clean, but I wouldn't call it dirty either. They had protein bars, drinks, and other snacks for sale. The shoes and harness I was loaned (in exchange for an ID) were in pretty good condition, but I found my shoes to be a tight 9, so may want to get a size up. When it was time for the first-time class, we were led upstairs to the beginner walls by a really patient staff member who taught us how to prep for climbing, belaying, and tying all the necessary knots. We all got a lot of individual attention, and we were taught 5 safety checks, which made us all feel secure. After, my friend and I had a great time climbing. Bouldering was too hard, but the walls were awesome. Some critiques:-more cubby holes would have been appreciated. I would suggest leaving purses at home. -$30 for a day pass is a bit expensive.

Took the bf with my Groupon and it turned out to be one of our favorite dates (no chocolate, flowers or fancy dinners required, just baggy gym clothes and plentiful wedgies!). The extent of MC's climbing walls and boulders are both intimidating and impressive. John was our funny/patient/all-around awesome instructor and did a great job teaching us everything we needed to know to climb and belay safely and effectively. Once you've taken the class, you never have to again, although there is a safety checks quiz that you have to pass on every subsequent visit to ensure you're not going to fall and crack your head open.Day passes and equipment rental prices are all very reasonable, and there are some traditional exercise machines available on the second floor (eliptical, cycling, etc., though the emphasis here is definitely on climbing). Locker rooms are spacious and there are tons of lockers in which to store your things (bring your own lock). I wish I lived closer because this would be my gym of choice (plusss, great music!).CLIMB ON, my friends!**A word of caution: PARKING IS A NIGHTMARE. It took us half an hour to find a spot 5 blocks away. Unless you have a residential parking permit, street parking is limited to either 1-2 hours, which honestly is crap if you're planning to workout/rock climb. Thursdays must be the absolute worst because it's street cleaning day on half the streets in the area, further compounding the problem. I just wish MC had their own private parking lot.**", "date": "2/25/2011"}

This is a full \u00a0Climbing gym, with a small free weight area and an even smaller cardio area. They offer classes as well, such as cross fit, and kick boxing among others. There is also a small shop next to the front desk where you can purchase gear, supplies and snacks. The Gym is quite large, comparable to the Berkeley touchstone location, Iron works. The walls are very high, and set on a fairly consistent basis. I especially enjoy the back corner where the highest walls are, and problems that deal with a lot of stemming and mantling. Anything with features on are great problems in my book. With a wide array of toprope and lead problems, many unique wall structures and features, its really tough to get bored climbing this gym. Their bouldering however lacks a bit. Its too cramped and tucked away upstairs. The quality of the problems presented are top notch, however, the congestion of them tends to detour us die hards. This can be a bit annoying, especially on packed nights where you have to wait in line to attempt a problem, and the constant risk of landing on someone or being landed on poses an unwelcome distraction. Hailing from the east bay, I often climb as much as I can with friends in the city locations, and I like a make a night out of it when I do. Often grabbing lunch or dinner while I'm out there. Mission cliffs is somewhat conveniently located near a lot good eateries and hang outs, mainly mission street, and surrounding areas. But its only a hop, skip and a dyno away from the SOMA and lots of other entertaining locations. Getting to the gym is super easy when taking Bart, and not to far a walk from the 16th st station. Being the most popular climbing gym in the city, it fills up pretty regularly, mainly during the evening, often making parking a hassle. This includes bike parking, as all the railings and outside posts tend to be jam packed with fixed and speeds of all sorts. The staff are great, and very helpful. But don't mistake their kindness with leniency concerning time, as they clear the walls 5 minutes before closing and expect everyone out by the tick of the closing clock hand.", "date": "12/16/2010"}

The cardio boxing class is great, and the yoga seems really legit. These are classes geared towards climbers/people already in shape, so it's a better work-out than you would get at a standard gym.They place new bouldering routes pretty often. BUT top-roping leaves a little bit to be desired if you go pretty regularly. Showers + sauna etc. are clean and well maintained. Central location AND easy to find parking nearby.It gets really crowded weeknights. If you go during non-peak times, it's a lot better, but then you run the risk of them placing new routes and having entire bouldering or top roping sections closed off. I was charged a late fee once because my credit card had been cancelled and I didn't get a chance to update the info with MC before the auto-payment attempt. They didn't really inform me of this until the next time I showed up to MC, which seemed odd to me. I will say that the membership fee is a little steep if you don't plan on going at least 1-2 times/week. If you take advantage of the day pass (weekdays before 3pm), it's $12 ... and 5 visits a month ($60) comes out cheaper than the monthly membership fee ($67).

My sister was the bestest and hooked it up with an Intro to Climbing class with Adam. He was patient, kind, friendly, and extremely knowledgeable. Then again, I would hope a certified instructor would teach us well since my entire body is hanging in a harness and a long rope! The class was small (only 4 of us on a Friday afternoon). We learned the basics of climbing and all the safety checks involved. We learned about tying figure 8 knots, being a belayer (basically, the individual on the ground that creates tension for the climber), and how the climber and belayer communicate with each other. The experience reinforced how communication is key. I found myself making indoor rock climbing/outdoor rock climbing analogous to life. It's definitely a new found love, for sure. If you don't feel like scaling walls, you can also work out on the cardio machines, take classes (if you become a member), and/or bouldering which is learning how to climb laterally. I wouldn't go suggesting this as a first time date or group activity though. It's a fantastic activity if you're needing some bonding time with people really close to you. It was such a great experience with my sister and reminded us that constant and clear communication is important! Most importantly, climbing is pretty meditative, believe it or not. It's just you and the wall and problem solving with your body. Come on, now! What more can you ask for...also, if you keep climbing, imagine how flexible and in shape you would be. Ummm, I'm pretty sure nobody would complain. :)", "date": "3/8/2011"}

I love Indoor, outdoor, bouldering, lead, trad, ice or any other type of climbing. The majority of my experience is indoor and I try to climb at least 3 times a week. So you can image my joy in finding a gym right next to my new job in San Fran. On the Pro side signing up for / into the gym was easy. They have a few self service computers where new comers can quickly enter their info and sign the waver. Once in, the routes are creative and with the difficulty variety there is plenty for everyone no matter what the skill level. I am also a proponent of the ATC friction device over the Grigri and its the choice of mission cliffs as well. While you cant take your hands off the rope to high-five anyone and still catch your buddy falling off the wall (like you can with a Grigri) it does offer more control and less friction taking out the slack while belaying an ascending climber. Now to the Cons. Parking, yeah its the city but still it should be said that if you drive, you may have issues. Veteran climbers may find the route difficulties slightly sandbagged. Great for making you feel like superwo/man but you'll constantly second guess your choices until you adjust to the new norm. The biggest con of all is the belay test. As a veteran climber who's been to gyms all over the country I've had to take my share of belay tests. I've even administered them but I always feel self conscious when I'm and never want to take them. However, I've never have I felt like the person giving the test felt the same way. The test started with one person who asked me to tie in. Typical 'show me your knots' stuff. Once done he asked me to tie into belay and promptly walked off. About 5 minutes go by before another staff person walks over and tests me on my belay technique. She tells me I failed but get a day pass. When I ask why she says \"I dont know, I'm just difficult\". When I ask her to tell me where I went wrong because I want to be a safe belayer she tells me \"You did everything right and your confident, dont worry about it. Here is your day pass. You can retest the next time you come in.\" I was with a group of people so I didnt want to argue. \u00a0When I shared my experience with my friends they all told me that it wasn't unique.

For one, they need to be more judicious about changing out ropes that are beginning to wear. I never felt unsafe, but it's hard to ignore the psychological effects of tying into fuzzy ropes that look like they've been chewed on, especially when you're just starting out. Second, when they raise their rates, they need to broadcast it as loudly as when they change their safety policies.

This is my first review...so be gentle I have memberships at both PG and Touchstone and I have to say in terms of climbing Touchstone (Mission Cliffs) is far superior than PG. The main reason? The routes. Going to M/C will make you a better, stronger climber. The routes not only require you to work on your technique but the routes will improve your overall strength and endurance. Most of the Mission Cliffs' Community are climbers, serious about the sport. I find that PG attracts more the of causal \"hey climbing is the new hip in thing to do \" crowd. Don't get me wrong PG a great place to learn how to climb but if you are serious about the sport and want to be around the climbing community then M/C is the place to be. The Good: Membership rates: $67.00 (this includes access to the other Touchstone gyms in Concord, Berkeley, Oakland and Sacto), climbing: routes are challenging, great lead climbs and I wouldn't know about bouldering.The Bad: Gets packed at nights, I recommend the weekends or early mornings.

YOU MAY BE RISKING YOUR LIFE.Everyone who climbs or wants to climb at Mission Cliffs should read this. I went with my boyfriend, who climbs there, on Monday, 1/19, and rented one of their harnesses. When I got to the top of one of the routes the strap on my right leg came apart. I was freaking out and didn't know what to do. My boyfriend was on belay and in that timeframe, there was no one at Mission Cliffs to help. Luckily (I was very lucky then), there was an experienced climber who got to the top and strapped me in again. I came down, shaken. I can't believe this happened. My bf and I check our harnesses and configuration before every climb. I had also gone through the climb and belay test just 20 minutes earlier and knew the drill. When we took the harness to the front desk, the guy there examined it and saw that the clasp on the right leg was broken and separated from the belt. And that was it. He took it in, no apologies, no calls to the manager, nothing. If this is the kind of gym you want to go, you better think twice. If they don't even check the equipment they rent out (which is extremely old), what other safety measures do you think they exclude on a daily basis?This was by far one of the scariest experiences I have ever gone through.

This not only messes up his/her concentration, but also can be very dangerous if the person falls off, kicking you in the head in the process. Give that person a little head start if he/she was there first.(Climbing \"through\" someone is the equivalent of seeing people waiting in line at the bank and just butting in at the beginning of the line while stepping on everyone's feet on the way past.)2) Don't constantly yell \"helpful\" instructions at the person you're belaying. \u00a0It annoys your partner, as well as everyone else within earshot.(Yelling instruction is the equivalent of picking your nose in an office meeting, then announcing to everyone that you got it and wiping it on your sock.)3) Don't let your children run rampant and unsupervised. \u00a0This is dangerous for them and the other climbers. \u00a0It's also very loud. \u00a0Inside voices please.(Letting your children run around willy-nilly as though they're in an amusement park is the equivalent of... well, letting your children run around willy-nilly anywhere else in the world that isn't an amusement park.)I love that so many new people want to check out climbing! \u00a0And, I think people are willing to follow social rules if they know what they are. \u00a0Hey MC, how about filling people in when they arrive for their first try at climbing?", "date": "1/25/2009"}

However, I finally decided to give it a go when my co-worker told me he had a free pass I could use. So I went, took the little belayers test thing, and off I went. Awesomeness on a cliff.It was harder than I thought it would be, and strange enough, easier than I thought it would be. I don't have much trouble doing pullups so I figured I'd climb these walls like it was no thang. I was wrong. Started on a 5.9 and it kicked my ass about 3/4 of the way up. After completing it and moving to a 5.10a I figured it would be much harder. But after applying some of the techniques I learned from climbing the 5.9 I found I made it up the 5.10a no problem. Then I tried a 5.10b and got my ass kicked again, hah. Regardless of the ass kicking I was always having fun and felt like I was learning something each time I went up. Bonus for it being back-friendly. I hurt my lower-back earlier this year so was concerned that the climbing might aggravate it but found it actually helped. After each climbing session my back is worked but relaxed.Aside from the main walls, there is also a bouldering area where you don't need a partner. Cool thing about the bouldering is that everyone is ready to help each other. People who don't know each other are often asking or giving advice or discussing how to tackle one of the routes. So while you don't have a partner in the bouldering area it's actually a lot more social and friendly (though the belaying area is also friendly).Next to the bouldering you have treadmills and other cardio equipment. Downstairs is a small free weight and machine area. There is a studio for Yoga and other classes. The bathroom has lockers, showers, and a sauna. The front area has a spot where you can lock your bikes or leash your pet. They also carry all the climbing gear you need and if you buy a certain amount (I THINK over $70.00) you get a 10% discount. If I remember correctly, renting the gear is about $5. Oh yeah, there's a foosball table, PC for general net access, and free wifi. With all that, the monthly membership ($60) is well worth it imo. So much so that I signed up on the spot after I used my co-workers guest pass and have been going ever since.

Some reviews actually only depict poor personal experiences and do not constitute objective criticism but most reviews, even those with high ratings, already report what I'm about to say but still, MC gets 4 or 5 stars, thus my previous statement: MC gets a great average simply because Yelpers love climbing in the city, not because of the gym itself.The amount of people on Tue, Wed and Thur nights goes beyond my mind: it's impossible to find a route, people literally climb and even fall on each others.An outdoor terrace on a warm sunny day with free beer wouldn't be any more crowded!The air quality is terrible; look at all the floating chalk in a ray of light or at the amount of dust on beams and furniture! \u00a0The air temperature is always off, way too cold or hot, fans are ridiculous and loud, thank god the poor staff members have an overhead heater. \u00a0The painting and lighting is so depressing and dark that I forbid myself to get inside on nice and sunny days.And it's funny how people line up for yoga classes, ending up exercising face-first in their neighbor's sweaty ass.Half the basic plywood hand-made lockers are damaged and boy! does that room smell like decaying sweaty old socks!

That had those insane upside-down overhangs, and was lead climbing only. \u00a0They've got a nice area for bouldering (rock climbing without a safety rope but only going up about 8 feet) too. Safety is crucial here and they're totally on top of it. Regardless if you're experienced or not, unless you have a tag from them showing you can properly belay & wear and tie your harness/ropes, they will not let you climb. Luckily for beginners, they provide a class that shows how to tie your ropes so you don't fall to your doom. They also show you how to properly belay so your partner doesn't fall to their doom. Not that anyone has so far. For pricing, \u00a0a day pass can be about $22+ with all the gear (shoes, harness, carabiner, and belay device. Extra for the chalk bag and chalk. Membership starts about $60+ monthly. Definitely pays off if you go frequently like all gym memberships.They've also got a small weight room and some cardio devices. Heck they even got a room with kick bags to increase stamina and strength. All in all a great gym. And if you're a member, you can go to all the Touchstone Gyms in the US as far as I know. Only downside is the place kinda smells funny but what gym doesn't?", "date": "6/27/2007"}

That will never ever change.We've been through a lot together, huh? Remember when I first gathered the courage to meet you face to face? Timid and naive, I took you on and only lasted three routes, the hardest being a 5.6. Unperturbed and confident, I came back around and slowly worked my way up your ratings as you worked your way into my heart. I was completely okay with the idea of you seeing other people (97.5% of the climbing populous of San Francisco), but I'm a pretty open and understanding fellow, I had a girlfriend as well, so who am I to talk? Yes, we were both happy and content.But over the past year, though I'm still thrilled to see you, I will have to admit that that flame deep inside me does burn a little less strongly for you. Yes, it's true, I have strayed a few times, but in all honesty, I don't think I can be blamed for that. To my dismay, your popularity has been increasing, so much so that I struggle for your attention most evenings. I know, there isn't much you can do about that: you're the only one in the city. And we've worked through that issue by agreeing to meet in the mornings and early afternoons. It's worked well for both of us so far, tho parking has been a pain during the day. But yeah, I know you're in the Mission, so that's kind of expected...But also, for being fitness oriented, you've let yourself go quite a bit. I know, I'm being very superficial--but I have to be honest here. I find irony in the fact that as you've helped me get more fit, you've pretty much stayed the same, and in some cases have let yourself go. Your weigh and cardio equipment is quite small and limited, your locker rooms aren't as nice as your contemporaries, and air filtration isn't so great. And would it be too much to ask to improve your lighting and just put on a little bit more paint and deco every now and again? I mean, yes, you are a natural beauty in that industrial, alternative sort of way, but even you'll probably feel better and more confident yourself if you'd spiffy up a bit more.MC, I truly do love you. You've opened my eyes to a whole new world and have given me so much. But I think it's time for me to see others again. Don't worry, I won't walk away from this relationship that we've built. You're somewhat close by, but please don't think that I'm just keeping you around for convenience. You're still dynamic and crazy in ways that the others aren't. I don't want to make any promises or lead you on, but there may once again be a future for us. Only time will tell. And though I may not always be around as often, you are always in my thoughts. Always.Truly yours,MPS -- How about brunch a month from now?", "date": "6/19/2008"}

The cave is small in comparison to say Planet Granite's expansive bouldering ramp and other varied walls. Oh you like cleanliness ???? Well forget about it... I find the whole thing to be filthy... seriously... broken lockers in the men's changing room, not sure how the ladies is, not enough lockers to go around, a space that is small cramped and smells of warm pabst, stale cigs and that general hipster funk that permeates every corner of psuedo intellectual fashion cliques... man I sound old, but really I'm not, I just really don't like mission cliffs.But its not all bad... in addition to the first come first serve yoga they have spin classes, something PG is missing, but to me isn't the main draw of a gym... there's the El tonayense taco truck perma parked across the street to reward a day of being hit with hipster shvitz and waiting forever for a route, but other than that I think its on par with my favorite climbing chain... so yeah... there you have it... enjoy...", "date": "6/19/2009"}

The class was about 1.5 hours long which does seem like a long time. There were 6 of us in the class but really that amount of focused teaching on something potentially dangerous is welcomed by me. We still had plenty of time afterward to climb on our own.Can I say that my mom (et mon mari) put me to shame? My fear of heights prevented me from making it to the top of the wall. My mom? No problemo. Go Mom!I liked the wide open facility. I had no problem with snotty attitudes from more experienced climbers. The facility was clean. Not smelly. Good times really. $28 for the intro class, equip rental and day pass is a bit too steep for a monthly thing but they have cheap equip rentals and day passes without the lesson if you know what you're doing.

The locker rooms are nicer at PG but the sauna at Mission Cliffs smells more like a sauna should - the wood is more aromatic and it's darker and more secluded than PGs.

The boundering area upstairs is also a good little spot, and there are plenty of friendly folks who are more than happy to give you helpful tips.I've found the climbing classes to be \"ok\", and you really need to be motivated to learn and ask a lot of questions to get strong benefit out of them, but still something everybody should do as they progress.People may compare IronWorks and Planet Granite, but hey, it's climbing, it's fun, leave the ego on the ground and just climb the frakin' wall. :) Climb on, baby!", "date": "1/3/2007"}

Surprisingly, bouldering doesn't get too crowded here during peak hours, probably because most people are taking advantage of MC's truly great walls.MC has some great top rope climbs. The back wall is really tall and always has a cool route in the corner that involves some stemming. When I start to get pumped, I head straight there to work some different muscles. One wall has a couple of overhanging parts, another has a sort of cave that you climb out of... tons of variety, typically good route setting... what more could you ask for? One quick note about the routes: they are usually easy for the grade. That is to say that a 10c at MC would be a 10a or 10b at any other gym.The real highlight of MC is the lead wall, which usually offers some great traversing routes. This probably doesn't apply to 99% of the people who read this review, though, because if you are capable of leading 12s and 13s, you probably already know this about the gym.

If you love the smell of hippies and sweaty feet, this is the place for you. Of course, I'm being high maintenance with that remark, since once you're 15 feet above the fray, the air gets better (albeit warmer). Coming from the brand new Planet Granite in Sunnyvale, however, my olfactory senses were at once offended. Yes, the terrain and routes here are more varied and consistent than at PG, but even after a few wonderful sessions I couldn't help but wrinkle my nose and look longingly at the doorway that promises fresh air. Bouldering is essentially impossible because of the stench below - are climbers deathly opposed to deodorant?! The locker room is just as filthy and run-down, if not more grotesque with all that sloppy wetness. Whatever semblance of a \"gym\" they attempted on the upper level doesn't work, because climbers don't want to bulk up, and hippies just aren't into that sort of thing. I've heard many great things about their yoga and pilates classes, however, I cannot personally so comment for lack of participation. Anyway, I'd rather be holding on for dear life in the wild or going back over to Planet Granite than to get my climbing fix here.

I'm not flirty. I'm not edgy. I definitely don't look like most people's image of a rock climber.However, I really like climbing. I wanted to show my kids how much fun rock climbing can be and teach them a few basic knots and how to belay. When we went to the Gym, we were completely ignored for 15 minutes while the attendants flirted with a departing customer who was 20, cute, flirty and edgy. We waited and I tried to keep my kids still while I tried to fill out the paperwork and get registered. After about 10 minutes of no attention whatsoever, on of my kids went and sat on a weight machine and grabbed the lift bar. We got a glare for that and I quickly pulled my son off the machine. No one spoke with us, but one of the attendants went over to the now vacated weight machine and wiped of some invisible fingerprints left by my 8 year old son. When I finally did speak to an attendant, he was cold and unfriendly and let me know that I could not teach my own kids and that we would have to take a class but there were no classes available now. We left.I tried to go back again with just my older son on another occasion. Again, we were ignored for an extended period of time. During the wait period, as the desk attendant finished an interminable telephone conversation, my son an I floated over to the edge of a group learning knots with a teacher. I was pointing to what they were doing and whispering names to my son, when the desk attendant approached me and informed me that we would have to pay $40 each if we wanted to join the class. Properly chastened, we went back to the desk and waited again. After another 5 minutes, we were allowed to sign up my son for a one hour slot with a belay er from the gym (I was not authorized of course, to belay my son). I do think the gym is a great idea. I would love to support it and be part of its community. However it does suffer a tinge of elitism. Its a lot more fun to head up to Glen Park or Berkeley's Indian Rock and boulder, \u00a0than to pay buckets of cash to snotty nosed, lycra clad desk clerks/athletes with attitude...", "date": "8/2/2007"}

I went for the first time a couple of years ago and was mostly impressed but that was back when I was a gym newbie...so what did I know?? This time...not so impressed but easily fixable. First of all I have to say the people at the desk (especially the older baldish guy) were extremely nice. I brought 2 friends with me, 1 never had climbed before and the other had climbed like twice in her life. The girl at the desk said I could show them what to do then she would check them out. We were upstairs and I was going over belaying with them. I was tied in and climbing up few feet, just so she could get the real feel of it. \u00a0This guy was nearby teaching a class and runs over to me and basically screams at me and tells me I shouldn't be climbing when I am not being belayed properly. I didn't realize I was really \"climbing\" a 5.4 anyways. So the whole checking off process of my friends took too long. There was only one girl who was checking everyone out, they just seemed under staffed. And I also noticed that no one really walks around the floor like they do at other gyms I have been to.The one thing I really liked about this gym was the longer routes. Most gyms only have like 30 feet walls so that extra 10 feet really makes a difference and I Ioved it. I really enjoyed a few of their routes. The bouldering area was ok. The crash pads looked pretty beat. And it was also pretty crowded up there, too crowded then what I thought it should be for a beautiful Sunday afternoon. The place did seem a little dirty and outdated to me but we are climbers and we like dirt!", "date": "9/10/2008"}

I am a member at Planet Granite, but a 10-pass holder at Mission Cliffs. I've been to PG San Francisco, PG Sunnyvale, PG Belmont and Mission Cliffs.I haven't been back to Mission Cliffs in a couple months, but I finally went back to try to use up my 10-pass. Note, I am going to rate the facility, not rate the sport of rockclimbing. Here are my impressions:PLUSES:1. I like the features of the rock. Tall walls, with interesting features in places. 2. The place is a little more relaxed. In Planet Granite, you are not allowed to teach your friend how to belay and tie-in. They don't care at Mission Cliffs... if your friend passes the test, he passes the test, doesn't matter how he learned. I like that philosophy.3. More attractive men, by far. ;-) Although I'm married, so doesn't matter to me, but maybe it is important to some others out there.MINUSES:1. The gym is poorly maintained, given the traffic. I prefer Planet Granite. Planet Granite is cleaner... but more importantly, Planet Granite routes use better holds that aren't just tape marked. In my opinion, Mission Cliffs probably gets the same amount of traffic as Planet Granite (thus, make the same amount of revenue, given prices are pretty equivalent), but they refuse to invest in new holds. They reuse old ones over and over again.. and they mark routes with tape. Planet Granite, on the other hand, typically has nice, newer holds and uses the same color holds to mark a route. Also, when the carpet gets worn out, PG replaces the carpet at a greater frequency than MC. I don't understand why Mission Cliffs is hoarding our money... and refuses to invest in making the gym nicer, given PG SF opened, and they now have competition.2. Ratings are sandbagged. Climbed a 5.10b as a warm-up, thinking it would be a good warm-up. It was like a 5.9.3. Staff has attitude. Well the girl at the desk had attitude, maybe the other staff members are fine. I was on my 9th day of my 10 pass.. and I don't mind that she asked me to show my belay card. But my belay card accidentally ripped off, given it is just a piece of paper. So I didn't have it. I explained it to her (and I have a lead climbing belay card from Planet Granite on my harness)... and she still treated me like I was trying to circumvent the system and get in the gym w/o taking the belay test (even though I told her I lost it, and I am happy to take another belay test). She gave me attitude, and gave me the impression that she thought I was lying. She asked me to sign another waiver.. which is fine, I don't mind. But to me, it seemed a little ridiculous. I am on my 9th pass of 10, so I am sure I couldn't have gotten in the gym on the previous 8 times without signing the waiver at some point. \u00a0There were even a couple of newbies taking the belay test, and they also were complaining about her horrible attitude. Get some nicer staff people, especially since there is now a competing gym in SF.", "date": "3/16/2009"}

The staff is super friendly and don't mind helping you out if you need it. The price is right if you climb in the morning but can't afford the monthly rate, but if you can, do it! I will admit I don't enjoy climbing in the evening. It's way too crowded, and I feel rushed. The morning crowd is great. A group of 50+ year olds climb with gusto and new parents bring their babies in their car seats. Bring your coffee with you and keep it on the bleachers, and don't forget your granola bar (it ok if you do, you can just buy one at the front desk). If your partner bails on you, you can always go up and boulder or if your feeling social, have the staff announce that your looking for a belay partner. As far as classes go... Yoga is great, it's catered to climbers and focuses on really engaging muscles and holding poses (at least the classes I've been to). If you're a bit rusty on the basics be sure to go to the all-level classes and let the instructor know. Warning: these are not your 24hr fitness yoga classes! You will sweat, you will feel stretched, and you will be relaxed when you get finished.

I remember when there were Robot structures with 20 foot slides at parks. Now they have punk-monkey ones that are four feet off the ground. How's a kid ever wanna climb a wall with out crying in front of it?  It's amazing I haven't broken a major bone yet. Only the end of my pinky finger from a freak, nursing accident where two IV pumps kinda guillotine-crushed my finger on an Obstetrical floor in 2005. You've never seen Joy crying like a baby. You shoulda seen it, it would have made you laugh. Little woman crying like a sad, little monkey in Dark Blue Scrubs one size too huge with a surgical hair net. Now, that's hot. The ER doc put Lidocaine in my finger to numb it so he could take off the pinky nail. I said sobbing, \"Now I know why women get epidurals, that hurts!\" (ER doc and my friend the ER nurse laugh-all the while the needle is jerking from his laughter). After he was done, I said when can I try to go climbing. Next year. Awesome. I'm absolutely thrilled. Meet Joy and her throbbing, disabled finger. Nice.Anyway, it's one of the reasons I have been a little shy about coming back until last May-I used my shoes for one time and made a new climbing buddy named Tiffany at Mission Cliffs during our Belay class who I could never get there because she had a boyfriend and she had lots of sexy time with. She then moved back to go to Penn State and haven't heard from her since. =(Then, insult to injury- some dumb, ass monkeys stole my rock shoes out of my car last year.Anyway, I finally got my rock shoes! Go to REI people and get hooked up!So yesterday, I was a happy monkey.New rock shoes that didn't kill and a climbing buddy who showed me new stuff. I was told by said climbing buddy that they change the routes almost every sixty days so that no one gets bored. I'll tell you one thing, Mission Cliffs ain't boring and if you say that, we can't hang.

Touchstone is one of those places that has their shit together with a full team of route setters that travels around their gyms to change routes and provide you with an ever-changing apparatus to get your climb on!!! when I first started going there, I saw all of these people with shirts saying \"20 Ton Capacity\", and I was like WTF.....Well there is a gigantic cranelift that sits near the bouldering wall that has a 20 ton capacity.....har har.....LOVE IT! I do have a couple of complaints as an experienced climber, and that is the climbing etiquette! People! If people are climbing up a route, DO NOT GO UP A ROUTE THAT INTERSECTS THAT ONE! PLEASE! IT IS ANNOYING TO HAVE SOMEONE UP YOUR BUTT WHEN U ARE CLIMBING! Also, some of the top ropes are pretty manky(and kind of scary). Pros: Awesome setting team, great top rope routes, great bouldering, good prices, and sweet lead routesCons: Can be kind of busy(After work), some of the climbers can be rude, and the weight gym is a bit old.", "date": "3/19/2010"}

There are a lot of different climbing routes, workout machines, equipment rentals/sales, yoga classes, and showers here. It was a super fun place climbing with my friends. I managed to pass the test on how to rope up and how to belay. Personally did 4 climbs starting with 5.5 and ending with 5.8. I was hurting at the end of the night but it was a great, healthy workout for all the muscles I don't normally use or have neglected to use in a while. I found in one visit I found it to be a very fitting place and activity for me to do top rope climbing. I am looking forward to doing more of this in the near future. Highly recommend this place.
