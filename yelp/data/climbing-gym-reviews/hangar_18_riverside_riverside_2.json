The gym itself is still a solid bouldering gym, but the attitude of the people here was just ridiculous. They literally could care less about their customers, and although the gym was almost empty both times I came to visit, it seemed like the staff would rather do anything EXCEPT help me.They also gave me an incredibly hard time when I tried to cancel my membership, but honestly, the icing on the cake, and what really nails in their 100 to 0 review is the fact that the staff member I was talking to was a total jerk and asshole about everything.", "date": "8/19/2015"}

A plus about the monthly membership is that you have one free guest pass a month so it's good to introduce the sport to those who haven't tried it. Also you can get free shoe rentals. After the first time climbing I ended up really enjoying it and purchased a Groupon for a two month unlimited membership. It was $53 for two months which is such a good deal because for students its $33 a month. They always have random deals on their website like two for one Tuesdays or $5 for a month of membership so be sure to check that out before you sign up! The staff is super friendly and the people that come here are really respectful too. I enjoy coming here in the afternoons because it gets pretty packed at night and you have to wait for people to climb so you're not all over each other. I liked that they started to purchase new rental shoes because the old ones started to get all stretched out and stuff. They have a lot of locations and it's nice that your membership gives you access to all the locations.

Today was a different story. A friend and I drove 30 and 45 minutes respectively each way to meet up here and climb at the time we typically do (6 pm, two hours before the advertised closing time on Saturdays). Today we arrived there only to be told the second we walked in that they had \"decided to close early for the day after the competition.\" We didn't get to climb a single route.Yes, they had a competition there earlier today. Yes, they'd posted flyers about it several weeks in advance. Nowhere on any of these flyers did they state that normal operating hours would not be in effect after the competition ended at 4 pm; in fact the flyer posted to their Facebook page stated the exact opposite - verbatim, \"The gym will continue normal business hours after the competition at 4:30 pm until closing.\" I'm so bummed the Hangar 18 chain is the only place to climb indoors locally, or I'd be taking my business elsewhere in a heartbeat.

It's my main gym I climb at. The gym itself is probably one of the best for the Hangar 18 gyms. There's a ginormous boulder alone for bouldering. There's certain parts on the boulder where you can top out and other places you have to climb down. The walls spread around almost the entire gym with plenty of routes for top roping and a section alone with overhang routes for lead climbing. The climbing community is great. The great thing about getting into climbing or climbing as a regular is that you'll always meet random people climbing there that are more than willing to help you out. I've made so many friends there that every time I go I'm always bound to run into someone. Lots of friendly climbers, I climb with a lot of my friends and the staff are always super friendly and easy going. Everyone pretty much is willing to help (everyone going towards staff and regulars). Great place overall. Membership is a killer price, shoes and harness always included. It's super cheap monthly and if it's something you're willing to get into, it's definitely a great deal. They have different classes and lessons for members as well. Overall a fantastic place to climb and be at to learn how to be a stronger and better climber.", "date": "7/24/2014"}

Let me tell you that I am afraid of heights, but once you go up the first time, you will forget about your fear of heights!Overall great experience, the staff was very chill and friendly. They have different levels of difficulty which are numbered. The lower the number means its easier, and likewise the higher the number means it is more difficult. For my first time climbing I did pretty well, I got up to 5.8. You have the option to do bouldering which are the shorter walls and you don't use any rope. This is way harder than climbing with the rope becuase it requires mainly upper body strength. I only did bouldering once going up the easiest level.

The atmosphere is great and most of the staff is very friendly and hands on. As I progress , there never seems to be a shortage of more experienced climbers who are more than willing to give tips and to climb with you. In my experience, the staff will help when approached. The reasons for four stars and not five , are only a couple things. The music: unless you bring headphones, you are subject to the tunes picked by the current staff; mainly using Pandora. Ex; as much as I love Frank Sinatra and hip hop, some styles may not always be condusive to a climbing atmosphere. The holds: are disgusting. Granted, it is climbing; which is expected to be gritty and dirty at times. Unlike outdoor rocks however, there is no natural ecosystem bringing in fresh air and naturally cleaning the holds. Finding caked on sweat and dried blood can make it hard to concentrate on a climb. Not to mention the overwhelming smell when up close to a not-so-new climb. I know they power wash the holds between sets, but they get pretty bad in between.That being said, I must say the rate at which they switch out routes is impressive; always something new every couple of weeks.And lastly; I tried yoga for the first time last week and loved it!!! It was very challening, yet fun and positive. Valerie was obviously a pro yogi and excellent instructor.

I think the biggest issue for most indoor gyms is offering a balanced array of problems for climbers of all skills. Many gyms offer just a few easy/medium while having the rest of the gym full of V5's and 5.10+. Unfortunately these few easy/medium problems are not enough to help the learning climber get to the V5/5.10 level. More problems need to be offered to make the experience of improving climbing skills more enjoyable. Thankfully, Hangar 18 offers plenty of problems of varying difficulty making it possible for even the most novice climber have plenty of options to have fun for hours. Self-locking gri-gri's is super clutch. I felt a lot safer when I first started climbing knowing that these fail-resistant devices had my backOne reason why Hangar has such a great selection of problems is the size of the gym. Hangar 18 is huge and offers many different slopes and angles for climbers. Hangar also knows that...slopers and crimps are fun, but not for everyone. Some people just like jugs (pun intended). And Dyno problem lovers, I know you are out there! This place always has a few epic dyno's that will make your adrenaline pump!Gym is pretty much half top rope and half bouldering. The boulder is beautiful. It offers caves, vertical problems, inclined problems, ridges, and the ability to climb over the top and walk down the stairs. Top roping is also set up very well. The more challenging problems are on one side of the gym and the beginner problems are on the other side. This is cool because you are climbing with people of the same skill so it's easy to get along with those around you.Service overall is pretty friendly. David, the building manager, is always very friendly and plays great music. Ask him to play his own music...seriously it's the best climbing music I've heard.Hanger 18, along with Sushi Asahi and the Mission Inn, are absolutely the best part about Riverside.", "date": "5/29/2012"}

There is a huge, free standing boulder in the middle of the gym. The walls for top roping and lead climbing are very short compared to what we are used to, so we only bouldered. The problems were not great. 98% of the problems were not taped. They expect you to be able to just follow the route using the color of the holds. This would have been fine in the gym was better lit. There was a section of the boulder that had an overhanging, cave like area. You couldn't see anything in there! There are only certain areas you can top out on the boulder. On the other problems, you either need to down climb or jump down. Some parts of the floor are better cushioned than others. Be careful... I hurt my self jumping down on to some harder flooring.

Pretty pricey yeah but after that day when you come back and know what to do you'll only have to pay the $16 for the day pass.Rock climbing reminded me of how out of shape I am especially when I tried to pull myself up a wall so remember to stay in good shape and prepare your entire body for a great workout!

I know Joe Morgan as he was a manager at my local gym for years and he is known in the climbing community as a very talented boulderer and an excellent instructor. The gym has many types of climbing, bouldering, top rope, and sport climbing available with very clear signs and well marked routes. The Boulder area is placed in the center of the building and has a large area where the climbers can practice mantling on a 20ft high boulder. The top rope routes are separated from the sport routes which naturally separates different skill level and age of climbers well so that 8 year old kids are not in the same place as the V12 or 5.13c climbers which makes for a good grouping atmosphere. The place is clean, new and well layered out. The signs say the rating, who rated it, when, the name of the route and any other info which is really great so there is no guessing and they seem to be very constant with their ratings or at least I from what I could tell. Also they offer yoga and Jiu Jitsu classes often plus many assorted climbing classes and professional emails to their mailing list too. \u00a0If I only lived closer I would make this a regular gym for me, maybe I will move back to the 'Side' one day.

Some of the sites have leaks in the roof which is not great when it rains. I haven't been to this site while it was raining, but I'm guessing it's probably not too different.The prices for day passes are so-so. Hangar 18 falls in the middle range for day passes if you just want to try it for a day. I've definitely been to places that were more expensive. Rock City in Anaheim is cheaper for a day pass, but you don't have as much bouldering, top roping, or space.Some criticisms I've heard is that the Upland site is not to challenging when they set their routes.

So I come here with my experienced rock-climbing buddy on a weekday afternoon. (I'm a newbie.) Nothing different or unusual with the rental equipment and waivers. There is an abundance of top-rope courses, both with friction and friction-free. Overall we had a great time and got a fantastic workout. However, here are a couple caveats:1. The staff: there was only one person on duty, who seemed to be really busy on the phone. Thus, I waited 20 minutes hoping he would get off and check my belaying skills so we could start climbing. When i finally decided to approach him, he walked out of the building, but came back in and said \"sorry i gtg dude, im at work\". great. so apparently he was chatting with a friend while people (including me) were waiting. Not cool.2. Safety: Most of the top-rope courses already have the first half of the knot tied in, so all you have to do is loop it through your harness and follow the pattern. No biggie right? However, I was a little worried when the couple next to us un-did the entire rope and asked us for help of how to tie the basic double figure-eight knot. Um, yeah, I was concerned because at Ironworks in Berkeley and at Threshold, they tested my basic knot tying before I was allowed to climb. 3. The Equipment: The gri-gri we rented had something wrong with it. All I know is that we had to pull the release lever all the way for us to barely inch down. We ended up practically climbing down on the courses that had friction. Secondly, when we asked to switch out our device, he said that we probably just weren't using it right, and to try again. However, when we tried the frictionless course, we had to open the lever full throttle and came down slo-mo. Then he had no choice but to let us switch.4. Lastly, if you like the smell of EtOH mixed with BO from the boys bouldering nearby, you would love this place!Ok, but overall, I would still go here again if you are confident or with an experienced person, and they actually have a good deal right now: $99 dollars for 3 months including free rentals each time and a guest pass every month.", "date": "3/1/2010"}

We were guests of a couple of members so we got the free deal which may have sweetened the experience. Not sure if that is an actual deal or not but the staff didn't seem to mind. Quite the opposite actually. He was very friendly and helpful. One of my friends was new to the sport and he gave her a quick lesson on belaying which I also had to participate in because they use Gri-gri's here. Most other gyms use an ATC device. The speed at which he went through the process was much appreciated since I wanted to get to climbing. Safety is important too, I guess..This facility is great for bouldering. The routes are rated accurately, I believe. ClimbX tends to rate their routes down. For top-roping the routes are fun but less dynamic than ClimbX. \u00a0I spent 5 hrs bouldering and climbing. I could've easily spent more time there as well but responsibilities and stuff. I probably won't be making the trek out to I.E. unless the price is right ($free.99) again but for those passing through this area I highly suggest it for training. Definitely a gem in Riverside. Did I just say that?", "date": "1/5/2011"}

I just had my sons 10 year old party there and it was super great. I had 8 kids and a few parents and even the parents wanted to climb! All the kids did it and had a fun time. The Hangar 18 people were so great, when we arrived they took charge of all the kids, got them outfitted in gear and got their attention for instruction. It was short and sweet and they got the kids climbing in no time. As a parent wanting to take photos and talk with other parents, I had to do almost nothing! The pros at Hangar 18 were so good with the kids I was very impressed. We even had a two year old and they were accommodating with her even though she opted out at the end. These guys ROCK! I'd even have an adult party here it was that fun. With a party reservation you get a big space on top of the center rock with tables and chairs and they already play great music. A great time was had by all and they provide all the gear needed.", "date": "4/15/2009"}
