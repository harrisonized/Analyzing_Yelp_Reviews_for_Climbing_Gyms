I was properly explained the safety precautions to take, the correct way to climb, how my shoes should feel, how my harness should fit, etc. When I came to climb for my first time at another rock climbing gym, they pretty much said 'have at it, have fun!' and I was off. Although there are mats and harnesses etc, it can be dangerous to go out there and not know what you're doing or how to properly put on your equipment. I felt so safe at this gym and I really thought that the staff really took care of me to make sure I had a safe and fun time. This gym is not only HUGE, it has something for all skill levels. They have walls for children, and great staff members that stay with the kids and help them climb. Something I really liked is that they clearly label the difficulty of each climb and my sister (who has a pass and goes often) says that they change the routes frequently so you're always doing something different. I can't wait to come and climb with my family again. Unfortunately, there isn't a Boulderdash around my house. Come to Long Beach!", "date": "3/5/2018"}

The route setting is truly the worst I've ever experienced in my decades of climbing. To say the ratings are inconsistent is giving them too much credit. Easy climbs that have loose holds and require far more technical insight than makes any sense. Then supposedly hard routes that send blindfolded. Frankly, I don't really care about climbs on the harder end of the spectrum (10+) that are soft, but when a 5.7 climb has a bunch of crimps, high steps, smears, and even dynos, it just plain unsafe. That's no way to build confidence in climbers. But the real problem with this place is that it's unsafe, which is really the most critical aspect of an indoor climbing gym. The staff is absent. Once you pass the front desk you will never see any one walking around monitoring for safety -- and given how many newbies riddle this joint, it's unfathomable how inept and self-involved they are. Most of the time talking amongst themselves, while I've watched people in the gym for their first or second time making life threatening mistakes. Only gym in the city that requires ATC and forbids Grigri. Supposedly something about insurance -- well if that's the case, your insurance blows and you might want to train your staff to spend more time keeping an eye on the clients. Whoever handles the insurance for Stronghold, Cliffs of Id, and Sender -- give them a call. Stupid policy to not allow Grigris. Ignorant or negligent staff, that reak of arrogance and minimal actual climbing experience. Lead ropes that should be retired. The worst route setting in the city by a stretch. \u00a0Not just a leaky faucet in the bathroom, but a broken one -- staff doesn't seem to care; hey guys -- the sign on the mirror ain't cutting it, the faucet is broken no amount of fiddling with the handle will change that.

I get to the gym (it's 8:48 a lead test only takes 10 minutes, if that), I walk up to Andrea, and tell her in a friendly way \"I'm ready to take my lead test!\" She looks at me and says \"yeah sorry I don't do lead tests after 9.\" Then shrugs her shoulders. I have taken a lead test, and watched my buddies take their lead tests after 9 with the other certified test employees. So it did kind of come as a surprise and I don't really think I shouldn't get the chance to take my test just because of someone not wanting to do something. Especially when it's not just a 10 minute drive from home. It sucks because I love Boulderdash and have gotten about 5 people to sign up for memberships.

Safety should be a #1 priority at all climbing gyms and I watched 4 separate belayers belay incorrectly (brake hand came off the rope EVERY TIME). Staff only came to climbing/bouldering section to give belay tests. Putting one more person on staff to stay on the floor and monitor would be wise and highly recommended. Those who are belay certified are given a TINY orange zip tie, which isn't a clear or visible enough indication of certification.Would be nice to have FREE staff belays, especially for the price paid for entrance.

I felt unwanted on my first visit (foo, you want my money or nah?), belittled when purchasing my 10-pass (...why?!), and one staff guy thoroughly creeped me out and made me want to hide every part of my body. And that was just my first visit. Last week I was ignored by 3 workers who watched me walk in and then looked away to continue their conversation. Triple diss, yay, just what I wanted after driving an hour after work to get here. Every visit to Boulderdash makes me regret having purchased a 10-visit pass on my first day. Unfortunately I still have visits left on that 10-pass so I'll need to come here and deal with the creepiness/rudeness/arrogance/being ignored (every visit is different to always keep you on your toes!) until those run out.

Wondering about the staff? How about a party for ADULTS?Wondering about the facility in it's entirety? Wondering why I'm giving it a 5-star review? Then read on...My husband was turning thirty and he wanted to do a repeat of last year's active birthday (games at the park then karaoke bar). But of course, I wasn't going to have 30 be an ordinary repeat of 29... Also, I was worried about the rain. So, with the fact that he and I always wanted to try rock climbing, I yelped and found this gem!BOOKING PROCESS: Their website is very detailed. It pretty much walks you through the process of taking classes, what to do when it's your first time, booking parties, etc. I was a little concerned about the fact that the reviews on yelp only covered kids' parties. After making the phone call to book it, I was immediately relieved as the person I spoke to on the phone explained that adults, beginners, and kiddos would have an awesome time! AND INDEED IT WAS AN AWESOME TIME! I had to send them a list of climbers so they can have the proper belayer to climber ratio. Just a tip, make sure everyone in your party fills out the waiver online prior to walking in in-order to expedite the check-in process. Parties are booked for only 2-hours and filling out those waivers in person eats up precious climbing time. 30-mins of that two hours will be spent in a spacious room for the party to enjoy some grub, cake, ice cream, or whatever the party in your tummy desires.STAFF: From start to finish, I commend the Boulderdash staff! The dude I spoke to on the phone was super friendly. I spoke to someone else on the phone to make some last minute changes and he was very helpful as well! When we got to the gym, they were very detailed with the rules, the timeline, etc. They didn't make any one of us feel rushed! A lot of us were first time climbers and they made all of us feel comfortable. They were EXTREMELY ENCOURAGING!THE CLIMB: We felt very safe and secure. They have plenty of roped climbs and the option to use the hook thinggy (yeah I'm a noob). They also have a bouldering section which had thick padding on the bottom to break your fall! They had different rated climbs with colored climbs for more of a challenge. They also have a crack wall for those who want to practice that type of climbing.OVERALL, I had a wonderful experience from start to finish! It was quite a difficult task planning a surprise party for my husband with 16 other people involved (not to mention someone literally asked him if he was going to go climbing on his birthday even after I've told everyone it was a surprise. Luckily he didn't pick up on it)... The staff at Boulderdash along with a few close friends and family helped put together a wonderful surprise for the hubby.

Over the last two years, we have moved from signing up for kid classes to hosting a birthday party with over 25 kids to taking belay classes (initially so we could belay the kids but now we often go without them!) to visit punch cards to membership, and most recently to learning lead climbing. \u00a0I don't think it would have happened it if weren't for the enthusiasm and support of both the staff and the fellow climbers here. \u00a0In my experience, the staff has been friendly and approachable. \u00a0I have never been made to feel like I couldn't ask a question, raise a concern, or ask for beta on something I was struggling with. \u00a0The few times we reported loose holds, they were immediately addressed. \u00a0There is very much a culture in the gym of climbers encouraging and sharing with each other. \u00a0The belay and lead classes we took with John and Matt were great, really focused on safety and technique. \u00a0It's actually a good thing that Boulderdash requires testing on a different day than class to earn belay or lead certification. \u00a0Climbing is of course by nature dangerous, and I was particularly impressed as a parent in seeing how Matt worked with our 14 year old daughter in the lead climbing class. \u00a0Sure, when we were first starting, I had wished that there were more weekend climb classes for those who just wanted to get on the walls without having to book private lessons or find time during a weeknight. \u00a0While I have mixed feelings about how it may limit access for those who just want to try it, climbing is still a sport, and I can't say I've seen too many negative reviews out there that there are limited drop ins for gymnastics or soccer or classes at conventional fitness centers. \u00a0Over and over, I have seen the Boulderdash staff be terrific with both new and regular climbers: I even held a team building event for our office here a few months ago with rave reviews from every one of my staff and colleagues who came out. \u00a0Having now climbed at quite a number of other gyms in LA and OC, as well as in places across the country, I have come to appreciate the route setting and the general community of Boulderdash, and am happy that it has become our home gym.", "date": "12/25/2017"}
