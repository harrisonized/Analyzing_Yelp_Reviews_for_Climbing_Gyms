They fixed the lighting issue and it is a great place to climb. They are renovating a large portion in the back corner, so some of the routes are limited. The gym has amazing potential and is a very comfortable and fun atmosphere to go climbing. I highly recommend it to anyone who is coming through for a great climbing work out and experience.", "date": "12/21/2015"}

Good place for a nice workout without it being too crowded. There's a small section of weights for use as well. Nice building, although the mats could use some cleaning. Clean bathrooms. Routes are clearly marked and staff is more than willing to help. Climbers I meet here are always really nice and would give you pointers. I would come more often if it wasn't so expensive. (I think I paid $13 for shoe rentals and for one day of climbing) But they also have packages and memberships and it helps if you come early in the day to get your money's worth. (Although I usually gas out after like an hour.) A really cool place for Arcata overall. I hear it's under new management. Excited to see the changes, although Matt was a really cool guy.Update: prices have gone up but the membership prices are extremely affordable!", "date": "2/12/2015"}
