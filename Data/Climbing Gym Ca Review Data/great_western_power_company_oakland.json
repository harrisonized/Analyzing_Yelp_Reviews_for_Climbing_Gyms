He is smart, serious AND friendly.Classes and teachers are awesome (with the exception of one female yoga teacher who is just on her own planet). Upstairs exercise machines and weight room are A-ok. Bathrooms could use some cleaning and updating. We all know how expensive this gym is so hopefully some of that money can go towards little touches here and there... like having paper towels and new non-molding shower curtains that close all the way).Last, in the ~3 years I've been with the gym, it has become wildly more popular which is both great (more climbers, welcome!) but also awful. There is hardly any room to stand or walk around the bouldering area during peak hours (which starts as early as 4pm and lasts until ~8pm M-F) and you have to wait to top rope routes because the demand is larger than the supply (also, only a few route 5.10a or easier... some 'easier routes' on the bouldering side but again, when it's a packed house... yeah right).

Hell, people here don't even bother to rerack the weights, which is literally the most basic form of gym etiquette, and the worst part of it all is that the weight room has zero staff on site to enforce basic gym etiquette. Even just a couple of signs explaining basic gym etiquette would probably do wonders.Also, only two squat racks (smith machine doesn't count as it's useless) and only one bench press station? Really? The weight room sacrifices essential lifting equipment in favor a bunch of useless machines that almost nobody there uses. If they simply added more bench press stations and squat racks and removed some of the useless and pricey machines this would literally be the PERFECT GYM.THE GOOD:The price is really good for a bay area gym, and the open crossfit area when classes aren't in session basically negates all the bad aspects cause there are more than enough benches and squat racks present there so serious lifters can get a decent workout in without having to navigate a sea of of oblivious people who dont know how to use a gym properly.", "date": "6/7/2017"}, {"review_id": "RyKzx59AOhNcSOLHyhXENg", "user_id": "Aa0u9wT267WL2_EGFzvOhw", "user_name": "Arcolina P.", "business_id": "NNloS0Q6nDRX4V4x0MaC6g", "stars": 1, "useful": 4, "funny": 1, "cool": 1, "text": "I was really looking forward to trying this place out.

I asked to look around, said that I was considering membership at discounted registration price. He said sign electronic waiver and look. The computer for waivers is on a shelf above a garbage can that happened to have some rotting food in it, slightly unpleasant.Then I looked around. No more interaction with guy behind front desk.

I was 5 mins late to class, because I had to go back downstairs to get a pass card to get into class. I ought to have been given this the first time when I asked at the desk. I opened the door at 6:05 and was about to stand quietly at the door, until the yoga instructor Liz Raven shook her head no and motioned me to leave. I waved my pass card to show her that the front desk had approved my attendance. To which, she rudely pointed to the door. The room was not full by any means, perhaps 12 people max. In India, where many of us yoga teachers go to study mats are touching. At no point, was it explained to me that students are turned away from class five minutes after it starts especially when you have a class pass to attend. And I have seen people come in late to other classes - and the instructors are only happy to have them in class. I can honestly say that these two experiences with GWPC have left me with a less than stellar image of this gym and Touchstone in general. The behavior is very unprofessional for a corporate gym. I bought a $100 new member pass to try out GWPC and Touchstone in general. \u00a0I was looking at having dual membership at Touchstone and Planet Granite...my home gym. But after this, I'll not be signing up for membership with GWPC/Touchstone.

I haven't yet had the pleasure of taking Marie's bootcamp, but I have taken yoga with Craig, abs/core (and yoga) with Avram, and did abs/core with Mike Rogers today.Avram is a super sweet and encouraging instructor; he keeps the energy going in his classes with great tunes and playful banter. He teaches abs/core on Tuesday and Thursday evenings; Tuesday's class starts promptly at 5pm and is generally less full than Thursday (which starts at 6:05pm). You will get sweaty, and you will partner up with someone next to you. The class gets you pumped, but is not impossible.Craig's mid-day Hatha/Ashtanga yoga class is good; however, I'd recommend placing your mat as close to Craig as possible. I could barely hear/understand his instructions when I did my practice in the back of the room near the speakers. From what I could tell, the flow worked well. Craig also introduced himself and thanked me for coming.Last, but certainly not least, is Mike Rogers - the crazy abs man. Others in the class said his class was far more intense than Avram's, and they were right. The class IS hard and you WILL feel the burn. Mike has a huge personality and great big energy, so he goes \"hard\" the entire class and encourages the same from you. B) Front Desk Staff: Never had any issues with anyone at the desk, except a bit of snootiness from one of the women. I most often see/interact with the light skinned, light eyed guy who seems to get off around 6/7pm. He's always extremely pleasant.C) General \"Vibe\": Most people who come here are pretty enthusiastic about their fitness. That being said, they are actually more interested in working out than say chit chatting or standing around looking cool.

The only unfortunate thing is that two days later, they started a promotion where they waive the $100 start-up fee. I ended up feeling a bit ripped off since no one had told me that if I had waited 2 days, I could sign up and save myself $100. I talked to them about it and they agreed to refund me half of the initiation fee, which was kind and fair of them. I guess if they had been a bit more generous, and refunded me in full, I would be their biggest cheerleader around, and I would have given them 5 stars for amazing customer service too.

They have multiple locations (parent company is TOUCHSTONE) that you can go to as well around the bay area and I believe one in LA. \u00a0The point here is that they have all the essentials for you! \u00a0However; here's what sends them above and beyond from your typical gym:Bouldering/Top Roping: \u00a0Obviously, what they're known for here. \u00a0You can rent shoes and equipment if it's your first time. \u00a0You do need to go through individual instruction and approved before top roping. \u00a0I'm happy with the variety of paths on the bouldering wall and they are pretty awesome at changing it up consistently to keep you hanging on the ledge (pun intended). \u00a0You'll know right away who's been coming here for quite some time and are really good; but they're all very welcoming, motivational, and supportive. \u00a0I've been given so many tips (I definitely needed it). \u00a0I've made some friends and recognize faces around Oakland here. \u00a0If you don't have a top roping partner, tell the front desk and they'll make an announcement to find you one; it's not embarrassing. \u00a0There are usually other people looking for partners. \u00a0I say try it! \u00a0If you love it, then stay and come back. \u00a0Don't worry, every one falls; there's very thick, padded, and soft flooring and mats to catch you. \u00a0They do have a first aid station for you should you require it.Competitions/Events: \u00a0They throw several events and competitions for the community. \u00a0I've received a free t-shirt and pizza while watching kids, children, teens, and adults compete on the walls. \u00a0It's pretty exciting and the amount of skill and strength it takes is extremely impressive (life goals). \u00a0You can throw parties here too but you'll have to inquiry within about that. \u00a0I do remember coming in during some company's work event (you're still welcomed to climb at the same time). \u00a0They have a lot of merchandise and food available to purchase too.Crowd/Patrons: \u00a0Like many Oakland businesses, you'll find every sort of person here. \u00a0There is no discrimination nor judgment. \u00a0Everyone of all sizes, shape, race, sexuality, age, form, gender, you name it comes here and has an enjoyable experience. \u00a0Come all welcome all here.Location: \u00a0Right in uptown. \u00a0You can go workout, take a shower, then head into the night life!Anyways, there's plenty more that can be said; but my best recommendation is for you to just come by and to try it out for yourself. \u00a0I don't think any review can say it all so stop by the front desk and I'm sure the friendly staff can tell you everything there is to know!", "date": "7/29/2015"}, {"review_id": "yDFFn56T6pF3QNjmewiuVw", "user_id": "jbLwHsY8lpS_v157cNBZAg", "user_name": "Jenna K.", "business_id": "NNloS0Q6nDRX4V4x0MaC6g", "stars": 5, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "I give this place a five star for multiple reasons:1.

The small size makes it feel more homey though, and I'm just really partial to this gym.There's metered parking on 20th and free parking on some of the neighboring side streets (which I always go for, because the meters are crazy expensive!).I find that there frequently aren't as many lower level routes here for warming up/ for beginners (5.9, 5.10 a), but the ratings here also seem a bit generous (so sometimes it seems like a 5.10b could easily be rated a 5.9). The workout area upstairs is super cute, though I always wonder why they haven't turned the ellipticals and other machines around to face the window? Seems like that would be nice!One of the things I really like about the Touchstone gyms in general is that they double the rope at the top anchor, so there is additional friction that prevents the belayer from being lifted up from the floor.

But it's great if you come by here once every couple of months to climb on new problems.

I called 5 minutes later to ask the front desk staff to please put it behind the desk until I came back in a couple of days. The front desk staff said that they did this. When I showed up a couple of days later, no yoga mat to be found, no one had ever heard of this yoga mat. It was a really really nice yoga mat, otherwise I wouldn't care. And otherwise someone wouldn't have swiped it, I'm sure. I asked them to please ask the other staff to be on the lookout. I go in every couple of days to climb and to ask about my yoga mat. Each time the staff have never heard of the stolen yoga mat. So this tells me that they really don't care, and I suspect that a staff member swiped it. This has nothing to do with my ability to climb at the gym, however, just be aware that the way the gym is set up makes it really easy for someone to walk off with your stuff.

I had heard that the Touchstone Climbing gym memberships were valid at any location, and I was planning on making the San Jose location my next gym, so I thought I would just start my membership early at the Oakland branch.When I explained this to the employee at GWPC, he hesitated to let me register. He explained that, while I was right about the membership granting access to all Touchstone gyms, each gym collects statistics on membership initiations. Presumably these statistics are used for internal review/reports. I understood, and prepared to buy a day pass.To my surprise, he instead suggested that I climb for free, taking my word that I would start a membership with Touchstone soon, which I indeed have done.Great staff aside, I also had a blast bouldering here.

GWPC is definitely worth a look, and if it's local, it may be awesome for you, but it defintely made me glad one of their other gyms is closer to home. My termonology may not be correct, but I think you'll get the gist. The bouldering wall is either straight up and down or has a serious overhang, with not much curvature overall. All the walls in this place seem to be taller than my normal location, which on the bouldering wall specifically I guess is to make up for the lack of interesting rock formation. This was my first time climbing on a corner, which was... abrasive... my poor fingers.. but overall the climbs are less exciting on the V0 & V1 routes. Hey, I'm a newb, that's the best I can manage, don't laugh! ;)The belay walls are really crowded from about 6pm on, and we often had to wait 5-10 minutes for a spot that I could climb. There are tons of 5.10A and above routes, but a very select few lower levels (I think I saw 2x 5.7s & 2x 5.8s. The lowest route I saw was a 5.6, so if you're truly a beginner, this won't be the gym for you. They have lower levels (I've seen down to 5.3) at other locations, but if you can't climb a 5.8, you're better off sticking to one of their other spots.I didn't check out the upstairs yet, which I hear is marvelous, and the ladies locker room was small but clean, so it seems they're on top of that. They monitor their floors a lot more than any other location I've been to, so if you don't have your belay card, you'd better get it, because they'll catch you.Overall I think I'll need to give GWPC another couple visits to have a well-rounded view of the place, but for now I'd say it's alright.

The climbing areas are pretty small. The bouldering area takes up the whole left side and the toproping gets the middle and right side. The toproping area is a decent height. Since the gym is brand new, the walls are brand new. These bouldering walls are like sandpaper and just there you up if you make the slightest mistake. Simply touching your knee or elbow against the wall is a guaranteed rip/burn. It's harsh. It's a complaint but about something that is brand new. So, hopefully now it's been worn down a little bit.Upstairs there is a full fitness center. Everything you need is provided. At the end of the second floor is a yoga room or a multi-purpose room.

Later I was watching some people climb around me who did not even know how to tie a figure-8, which made me feel uncomfortable.The biggest problem was with the anchors at the top of the top roping courses. The ropes stuck so much that I was barely able to pull them though when belaying. My girlfriend, who is pretty small actually couldn't pull through some of the rope and I had to stop a few climbs half way up. I had enough when I was belaying her, went to lower her, and nothing happened! I had to throw her some extra rope, make her hold onto it and literally pull her down.
