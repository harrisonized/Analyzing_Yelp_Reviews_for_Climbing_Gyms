Their grading system is just by numbers which I think is cool because it encourages you to just jump on any route and attempt it instead of being intimidated by the tag level.

They said their was no way to get a refund, so I had to wait another month. I decided to just use the month since I couldn't get a refund. They reasonably require collatoral for their equipment, but I stood at the counter waiting for someone to give me my car keys back, so I could leave, for over 10 minutes. They got rid of some of their mats, left the old ones out in the parking lot in the way, and when I asked if they were free I was told anyone could grab them. Later when I was leaving I told them I would pick them up the next day, and they said I could buy them for $100 each! It has obviously not been a good experience for me.

Riverside, imo. The toprope and lead walls are obviously much smaller than the other Riverside location's, so if you're primarily looking for roped climbing, that gym is probably a better fit.
