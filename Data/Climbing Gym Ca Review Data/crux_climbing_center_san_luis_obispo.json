I've been to about ten gyms in the US and Europe, I'm used to taking what I can get. At first I was taken aback when I didn't recognize the belay system but the woman explained they invented it (these are not the blue/grey circular auto-belays you see in other gyms). While watching the required video, I thought about leaving because it didn't match what I know about climbing gyms. HOWEVER, I'm really glad I didn't leave! This gym is totally a labor of love by the owner's father. He designed all the rock walls (!!!!), which imitates climbing outside. HELL YEAH! I prefer this 100% to contemporary style gyms. Sure, there were some slick areas because it's been there a long time (over 20 years I think), but the routes are 100% more fun than the new style gyms with colored holds. Even the belay system is better than the blue circular auto-belays because it doesn't bring you down to the ground if you come off but holds you in place like a human belayer would, which means you can work on a crux. The routes were really interesting and fun; the sides, arrets and overhangs were awesome and challenging and you don't have to hang on fully extended shoulder joints the whole time like in regular gyms because the wall imitates rock - so you use your body in the more-complicated ways you do outside. I wish all gyms were this interesting. You can climb each route totally differently since it imitates rock, thus there are no grades or specific lines except that the walls become more difficult as you move into the center of the gym. I've never climbed anything like it and wish all climbing gyms had natural features. Also, other than my own gym, this is the ONLY gym where I didn't feel judged or watched by the staff. Since I arrived two hours before closing on Easter weekend, there were only two other people there when I arrived. The owner and I had fun talking about a variety of things. No bratty hipster climbers running the place, thank god. I'd love to have these types of walls in my gym.

Luckily, the owner arrived - (drumroll please) and made the situation deteriorate from there.The owner's glib and boisterous attitude was wonderfully complimented by her own personal mantra: \"don't ask questions or understand how things work, just climb.\" This was not only an uninformative atmosphere, but one that fostered a downright dangerous mindset for new climbers, which is clearly the target demographic as any self-respecting climber would quickly abseil away from this foundering wreck of a gym. \u00a0 \u00a0 In addition to some of the worst managerial work I have witnessed in recent memory (from the owner, no less) the gym itself is quite run-down; the rock surfaces are worn smooth, all major and minor surfaces are entirely covered in dust (like the employee(s)? ever climb so they could clean them, HAH!), the auto-locking carabiners were gummy and needed to be forced shut manually (after much effort), the ropes are dirty and stretched out and the auto-belay would occasionally \"stick\", meaning that if one were to keep climbing that they would essentially be free soloing without any protection.  \u00a0 \u00a0 I only went there so my friend could use a pair of shoes since I didn't have an extra.

Everything was clean and organized and the equipment looked quite new.The beginning part of our experience was quite hazy because all I remember is going upstairs and the husband frantically strapping me because the instructions from the video we were watching were going super fast. And then we went downstairs and pretty much started climbing! Although the auto-belay system is nice and convenient, it's so easy to cheat on that thing. When we got to the harder levels, we would sit and lean back on our harnesses, resting every few minutes before moving on, hahaha. Other than that, we had a fun time going through each level until our arms were about to fall off.It is DEFINITELY a much better deal to wait until 6pm on Tuesdays and Fridays to go because you get the student discount.
