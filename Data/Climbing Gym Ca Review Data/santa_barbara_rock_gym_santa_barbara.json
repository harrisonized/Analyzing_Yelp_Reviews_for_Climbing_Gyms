Normally, it's $15 but on Tuesdays, you pay $7.50. An additional $5 for shoes rental. I didn't get the harness because it was my first time and I was going to be climbing the shorter walls with pads beneath. If you go alone and want to climb the tall walls, their employees will spot you (belaying). For the short walls, be sure to move the pads to wherever you are climbing, but of course mind the other climbers.One of the guys gave me a quick orientation and they seemed real cool with answering questions and such. It wasn't so crowded when I arrived at 6pm but it quickly filled up and the whole place started to stink like feet... no doubt from the rental shoes everyone was wearing. I climbed three walls successfully and decided to get outta there. I found it quite easy, it's a lot of relying on your fingers strength with pinching rocks and shifting your body weight from side to side as you climb. Don't take my word for it, watch a YouTube tutorial, if you're a beginner like me. They color mark your climb so it's more challenging if you keep to one color rocks all the way up... I think people look down on you if you use any color to get to the top. lolI would've had more fun if there wasn't so many people sitting around watching the climbers. Made me very subconscious swinging my ass around up there. I know it ain't like that but who the hell knows for sure.Also, I noticed that some of these guys like to study the markings a little too long before they climb.

At SB Rock Gym, they refused to allow my guests to become trained in belaying. I still don't understand why. Their staff members insisted that there is no place in the country that will allow you to become certified in belaying and immediately climb thereafter, but that statement is belied by my own experience at Mission Cliffs (SF), Planet Granite (SF) and Go Vertical (Philly) and a few other places. They also inexplicably refused to allow me to bring in my own Vibram 5-finger shoes (which I have used for climbing for the last 5 years at least, without any problem), and made me rent their shoes for $6.

I can literally just boulder every wall here... literally. There taller walls were as tall as the bouldering walls I've bouldered on at other gyms, and high balls outdoors. I sport climb as well and I was shocked to see that this place does indeed have a lead wall... which is surprising considering that this place is pretty short. I'd be scared as heck to test for lead, let alone take a fall. What is my belayer supposed to do?! Keep tension on the entire time, as if I'm going to get pulled off the wall?! NO WAY!The general price to climb is $15. I decided to pay the $15 because I wanted to pull on plastic that bad. Their rating system is odd, however, I do kind of see their theory behind it: They rate their problems by color and not the usual Vscale because they want to encourage everyone to get on everything and not be fixated on the ratings. TOTALLY UNDERSTAND, but what about those who are new to climbing? They won't understand the Vscale. What about those who want to see how much progress they're making? They can't just be like \"Hey I'm a YELLOW COLORED CLIMBER\" or \"Hey I just crushed that GREEN!\". \u00a0What does that even mean? Also, the routes are rated accordingly, but what about the subdivisions within that specific rating?

The best way to get there is to park in REI's parking lot, and walk down the street and turn left onto State until you see it. The gym is priced fairly, and the half off Fridays make it a really good deal. Even on fridays, its never too crowded, and you can always get your workout in. The gym utilizes it's limited space well, and the bouldering rooms are one of the best I've ever seen. The bouldering walls have unique terrain and route setters make great unique routes that work with it really well. And its updated pretty often! The top rope on the other hand... The top rope is pretty much glorified bouldering with a rope. The entire corner closest to the window is just a mess, with incredibly short routes. The parallel walls in that corner are too close to each other, making it a tight space for belayers. Routes are not updated frequently, which is especially important in a smaller gym like this. Don't get me wrong, the top rope is great for parties and kids who wont mind the shorter height, but for more experienced climbers it really doesn't cut it.

Not to mention you're surrounded by some of the most chill people in the population... Regardless, SBRG has completely circumvented this issue and is run by a talented, warm, solid group of passionate climbers. \u00a0As I mentioned, the routes are awesome - there's nothing worse than climbing in a gym, and finding that the routes are clunky and lack any flow. \u00a0There's a good balance between easier routes and problems and more difficult projects. (And for any lead climbers out there, they've got a great arch that's always got at least a few challenging routes on it).If you live in the Santa Barbara area or are just passing through, I \u00a0definitely recommend you check out SBRG and get your climb on.", "date": "2/9/2013"}, {"review_id": "FC3CNAz68G2Kz0eZa4dSuw", "user_id": "OnyPESeFF8P449v3cpcw3g", "user_name": "Ben M.", "business_id": "i_VY8EEOxZlNnXrESAhmig", "stars": 5, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "text": "I started at Santa Barbara Rock gym about two months ago and I am officially hooked.

We had a groupon for a lesson and we were taking the kids while the grouponee had their lesson. However I ended up joining the lesson. I was not properly dressed to be a participant but it worked out. Ryan was super patient and made sure that we were safe. Falling 20 ft to my death would be utterly traumatic to my little guy. (This is obviously dramatized and exaggerated as there are a zillion backups in case one thing failed). He taught us to make sure the harness was on right, that the ropes were tied securely and kept reassuring me that I was safe. I'm petrified of heights. Insanely petrified. I hit a mental wall midway through the 2nd climb up and Ryan talked me out of my almost cardiac arrest. He coached me through and wouldn't let me give up. Trust me, I was mid meltdown and ready to call it quits. He was super calm and professional, gave some tips, and I hit the top!!! Then I was stoked to be down on the ground and I made out with the floor until it was borderline humiliating and tragic. Thanks Ryan for making sure I finished so I looked super badass for my kiddo!I can't even climb a 6 ft ladder without having a panic attack! I'm stoked to have done this - been wanting to forever - grateful to have crossed this off my todo list with my pride and ego intact.My kiddo loves coming here. You'd think that for amateurs a place like this would be intimidating but it's actually really rad. Everyone is super nice and encouraging and he always has a good time (he's 5) and scaled up 2/3 way on his own with a belay today, a personal best (usually he'll free climb up about 5 ft and jump down). This is a great place to get kids interested in sports and at their own pace. And it's super safe for them to do. The staff is always helpful to answer questions. It's nice that decent climbing shoes aren't exp and well worth the investment instead of renting them. Will 1 lesson make me comfortable to do it solo - no.
