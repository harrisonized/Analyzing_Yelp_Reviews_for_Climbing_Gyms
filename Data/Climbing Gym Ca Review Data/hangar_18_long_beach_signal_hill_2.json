Two weeks later, and after losing my mind trying to find my drivers license, I call them up. They have it. As well as ALL my contact info I used when I signed up. Including my phone number. They could have contacted me and did not. The manager lady told me they have a stack of ID's left over and acted insulted when I suggest that since they require people to provide the gym user contact info, they could simply look people up, call them up and get them their ID's back. Nope, not interested. Apparently they simply do not care about helping people out. Then she got bent out of shape at me for calling her out on the fact that they had my ID and my contact info and never called me. I requested they mail my ID back to me. She sounded like she would be doing me a huge favor. Even though they neglected to return my ID to me, or call me when they noticed they had it. The final icing on the cake is that the ID never arrived. They lost it. After repeated calls, not a single employee can even confirm that it was mailed out. The woman manager I spoke to clearly ran out of 'give a f**c' a long time ago, has no interest in providing a service, or even doing the minimum to help people. I would pay money to never use their gym, or interact with her ever again. Don't make the same mistake I did. Other than that, the gym was ok.

Our group bought intro classes off of Groupon which averaged to about 15$ a person.

My first time up, I panicked with the fear of heights kicking in. My entire body trembled and I was getting sweaty all over. After the second time I got the hang of it and it wasn't so bad. I think it's one of those moments where your mind is playing tricks on you and you think you're falling when in reality, you're pretty secure with the rope. You have to trust the person that is belaying you. They also have two routes where there are auto belays. At first it will seem scary to get off, but once you let go it will ease you down. After a couple of runs, my arms were fatiguing faster and I was losing my upper body strength. I wanted to play more but my body was getting weak. I highly recommend getting the chalk because after awhile your hands can get a little clammy. Our group spent about three hours here until we were exhausted. Bring lots of water!

Some of the Hangar locations are better than others due to overall maintenance and staff. This location is definitely a lot more well maintained, and is also one of the newest locations. The crash pads are thick and don't look like they are falling apart. There's an even number of top roping and bouldering areas, and the overall layout of the climbing gym is very welcoming.

After coming here a few more times more than a year later I would say that there are certainly slight improvements.Bouldering sections have definitely improved! A big part is because of the climb it classics they had in summer 2015. However, climbing here at least once a week and getting to try out the new problems every week, I noticed one thing, they don't really know how to grade or set properly here. The setters seem to be strong dudes however you'll find climbing problems that are either way too soft or way too stiff. This can be hard on a lot of new climbers who probably won't understand why a V1 might be harder than a V2. Or a V6 easier than a V4. Sport climbing is still a bummer since not many people lead here or hardly any at all, so a lot of the routes are slippery and not reset as often.There's one guy who works at the front desk that always says hi to me and is super nice. The rest of them kind of just don't bother to care and the setters act as if they're better than you sort of attitude. Definitely a lot more room for improvement, the rock wall at my campus rec center is worse so coming here isn't too bad.

Now maybe I'm still a newbie and I don't know much about it at all so take my word with a grain of salt, but it seemed to me that the grading wasn't...right. It seems like most of their routes rely a lot on strength rather than feet or technique, especially on the \"easier\" grades. I don't know, to me, their routes were just weird. There was a V0 I couldn't do but I could do V1s and a V2?

Oh or which walls I would actually climb on?!?!?! Might have been helpful info to receive from someone who was paid to help me.And don't be mistaken by my description of the place being packed. We were the ONLY ones at the front desk. The \"packed\" part were just climbers.SO after some advice from my friend, we started climbing. It was cool. We had to wait for every wall to become available because so many people were crowding it.Thing about the walls though. Sometimes hard to distinguish colors. A lot are very faded. Some had taken on a new color all together but the original color could still be seen. One appeared to be smeared with bird poop. My friends and I had to tell each other \"That one is white...blue...light purple!\" while we were climbing because there are difficult ones to distinguish.BUT to top it all off, we're about to leave and my friend asks how much we paid, seeing as how Tuesdays are BOGO free. I told him, thinking that what my friend and I had paid together was only the price of one, seeing as how the guy charged my friend the BOGO price a minute before he charged me. NOPE. Mentioned it to the dude man and he says \"Oh that deal happens only if you mentionnnnnn it\". AKA you're new here so I'm taking advantage of you. Well after I MENTIONED it, I got half our money back. Dude. Geez. I'm just new. I'm not stupid.So, the rocks were cool.

They change them out regularly, but not so often that I can't have a couple weeks to really work on a tough problem. Not only that, but the gym is functional for a climber's needs, if a little barebones. All the weights are there, people usually re-rack, there's no sharp points and the upholstery is still intact on the benches.

Not only is the monthly price less than anywhere else, you get access to 8 or 9 gyms around the Southern California area. And most of those gyms are super nice. Riverside, Upland and Rancho Cucamonga are all great - five stars for them!This specific Hangar is a disaster. The holds are old and most of them are spray painted, which makes them greasy - which only gets worse after every use. It's really bad for you if you're trying to learn how to climb because it's hard to build up the right muscles and learn how to move your body if you spend all your time sliding right off the wall.Second, the setting is really weak. Climbing here just isn't fun, a lot of the climbs just don't make sense, and even the ones that do don't flow. It makes climbing feel like a chore.Third, most of the employees are unfriendly, unhelpful and don't really care about keeping the gym nice, clean and safe. Big ups to the blonde female employee who works during the day and is the exception to this rule. Recently, the crash pads had migrated several feet away from the wall creating a pit of death on the easiest part of the wall, where most beginners would be focusing their attention. It had been that way for months until this female employee organized a group of climbers to help move the whole thing back to where it needed to be.Safety needs to be all the employees first concern, but most of them are too busy trying to act cool and impressive with their Christian rock blasting over the gym's speakers.I wish this gym were better.", "date": "1/7/2015"}, {"review_id": "_g1_xnrQUAjm5l1LBS6LjA", "user_id": "Jv4vFPIzhyzC073RqiqcvQ", "user_name": "Will L.", "business_id": "NdtseuifGWxPmZWLVmI-fA", "stars": 1, "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Had a month pass and it was great, shoes and harness was free.

I started bouldering at the Seattle Bouldering Project which is ~20,000 square feet of bouldering with routes that are reset weekly. I didn't realize it at the time, as it was the only place I had ever been climbing, but holy cow, it was amazing. If you're ever in Seattle - GO. Anyways, back to the review at hand. I missed climbing since moving home to California and when I saw this place, conveniently located to my house, pop up on Groupon I snagged two one month memberships for me and the dude. We went last night around 8 and quickly filled our our waivers and got checked in. We had no interested in climbing with ropes and had brought our own shoes, so we listening to the quick safety lecture and were released to go climb. The bouldering area is much smaller than what I am used to, but I'm thinking it's actually pretty large for climbing gyms in So Cal. There were quite a few people climbing but it wasn't so busy that it felt over crowded. I haven't climbed in close to a year so my upper body strength is sorely lacking so I did get a bit frustrated that I couldn't climb most of the routes and I definitely think they could use more actual beginner/V0 routes. Much of what was marked as Vb, V0 and V1 may have been technically less challenging in terms of figuring out the problem, but they had been placed in such a way that you still need a decent amount of strength to climb. I guess I understand as when you're working with limited space and you need to cater to a wide range of skill levels you can't have a ton of easier stuff, but I think it would encourage people to take on the activity and work up to the more difficult stuff if it was a little more approachable.We haven't decided yet if we'll continue our memberships after the month is up or if we'll check out some other places first, but I wouldn't have any issues sticking around here as the staff and other patrons were friendly and I love how convenient it is (though I do wish for early morning hours - 6 am climbing is the best!).", "date": "6/3/2014"}, {"review_id": "goJdCtR22apRlt4jlz29qQ", "user_id": "S02tduB61f8Ha8DrjYIMEA", "user_name": "Justine A.", "business_id": "NdtseuifGWxPmZWLVmI-fA", "stars": 5, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "My boyfriend and I recently bought memberships here.The first time we came in with my sister and best friend and we were met by Brandon who was very friendly, open and helpful.

They use Grigris and melons, which are not my favorite, but will work okay. My main complaint is that the holds were ridiculous. They are all these earthy tones that look almost like each other; I really pity anyone climbing here who cannot distinguish between brown, brown with the slightest green tint, and brown with a hint of yellow. Or maybe they would just assume those are the same colors and have an easier time climbing. it was frustrating constantly trying to figure out which holds were on, and what color I was looking at. The staff was really nice and helpful about it though. They explained that some of these holds were over 20-years-old, and that they were working on purchasing legit holds. Apparently this used to be a bouldering gym, so they would just use tape to indicate the routes...and now they were forced to make do with whatever \"colors\" they had. There were also some very interesting features here that I'd never encountered before, such as \"plates\" of fake-rock, and a wall of wavy looking rock features.The walls varied from very short to medium height...I'd say maybe 25 ft to 35 ft. The ratings at this gym, I felt, were incredibly inconsistent. At one area of the walls (the area with strange \"plates\" and earthy-colored holds), the routes were in general much easier than in the other area. I was able to complete almost all the 5.10s and 5.10bs I attempted on my first try, some with little difficulty. These ratings were probably on par with what I am used to. However, in the other area with newer holds, some of the routes were just ridiculous despite being 5.10as. They required some serious dyno-ing (over overhangs no less!), especially for someone of my stature (5'2''). I guess the route-setters were tall? Needless to say, these routes were...literally out-of-reach for me :)However, their Groupon (watch out for it) is a good deal, giving you 2 months of membership for slightly over $50, plus free classes and guests. I can't say that many rock gyms are so affordable.Verdict: Okay gym but the colors of the rocks nearly drove me mad.
