Everything is labeled by numbers to know where to start. V0 is the easiest but if you've never climbed it may not be (at least for me). Still a great experience even if you don't climb regularly. I'd recommend any level of climbers to come here. Their gym equipment is top notch \u00a0Wether it be weights, cardio or climbing equipment. It's all here.

I was visiting and used my membership for Planet Granite in the bay area at the Portland location, yay for free gym access when traveling! \u00a0In comparison to bay area this location is bigger, newer, and cheaper. I am not sure when this location opened but everything looks new and there is only a slight stinky foot smell, much less than other gyms haha. I was there on a Saturday morning with my date and we were both surprised how few people were taking advantage of this great facility. Climbing is always better when it is not crowded, so this was a real treat anyways. The main attraction is the indoor rock climbing walls. There are tons of trails for both bouldering and belay, much more than I have seen at any other indoor climbing gym (they say ~200 bouldering trails). The belay trails were the highest I have ever seen (up to 55feet)! We did bouldering during our visit and got a great session in. \u00a0There are trails of all difficulties, an area where you can top out, some overhangs and a ramp. You might see a rock in the shape of a baby face.Additionally there is cardio and lifting equipment, a yoga studio, and fitness classes to get you moving. Some of the cardio equipment overlooks the belay walls and gives a great view to enjoy while getting those treadmill miles in. Memberships are very reasonable for everything that is included. I did not like that they charge an initiation fee, which just seems like a useless fee. However, their membership cancellation policy is very fair and better than other gyms. There are lockers, showers, and towels.

If you are like me (a powerlifter, olympic lifter, or CrossFitter, and visiting Portland from out of town), this is a great gym with all the equipment and facilities you will need for a good training session. Let me break down why it's so great:1) The overall facility: bright, airy, and huge. A lot of climbing space as well as fitness studios for classes. Really liked the music playlist. 2) The locker rooms: also big, clean, and well stocked. Lockers require your own lock (this is a good thing I think) and showers are good. 3) The fitness equipment: really, really great. Two large rigs for barbells (squatting, benching, etc) and pull-ups, three concept-2 rowers, two airdyne bikes, two GHDs, about 20 total barbells of various weights with lots of corresponding bumper plates, lots of dumbbells, lots of kettlebells, wall balls, plyo boxes of various heights, as well as a few treadmills and elliptical. If you can't do your olympic/power/crossfit workout here, it's way too complicated. Lots of space for stretching as well.4) Prices: pretty standard for drop-in: around $20 depending on when you come.All in all, a great fitness section to get your lift on when you are in town (and a great gym to join even if you don't climb). Two small annoyances to note (not quite enough to bring the gym down a star, but almost): 1) Even if you tell the staff that you are only there for the fitness equipment, they will still make you watch a safety video about climbing before you can enter. This is a complete waste of 20ish minutes. 2) They don't have any rules stopping people from going barefoot in the weightlifting portion...and lots of people do it...sort of nasty.

In fact, when I get dropped off at work in the morning I drive by and see folks working out inside and I yell, \"Good morning, Graniteers!\" \u00a0I don't think they hear me, but it makes me smile. Made me smile so much that I started liking the idea of being a Graniteer myself. \u00a0But I've always thought climbing was for skinny people with long, tan limbs and sinewy muscles that flex even when they are standing still. \u00a0I always thought that a strong, big bottom gal like me (we make the rockin' world go round, you're welcome) just wasn't built for it. \u00a0I've never been able to do a pull-up, wouldn't that be kind of basic? \u00a0What did I know? \u00a0Nothing. \u00a0But the more I looked, and cheered, the more I thought about it. \u00a0Then I was at a park in Colorado that had an informal wall with holds, just a fun place for kids to clamber up, maybe an adult too. \u00a0I reached out and spidered all over that wall, and someone watching said I did a good job. \u00a0It was fun. \u00a0Right then and there I decided to become a Graniteer. \u00a0I went to the website, checked my calendar and signed up for a four night basic climbing course. \u00a0My instructor, Lindsay, is one of those people with energy to spare. \u00a0She is very knowledgeable and shares, explains, and demonstrates what is needed with ease. \u00a0She helps me feel confident. \u00a0She patiently taught us some knots we needed to know, and then said, You got it? \u00a0And I'm like, Nope! \u00a0And she went through it again with a smile. \u00a0I finally got it, and we climbed, and climbed, and she pointed out tips and techniques that made sense. \u00a0I could see what she was saying playing out all around me, watching the other climbers. \u00a0 The other three folks in my group are all very relaxed and easy to know - we takes turns on the belay with each other, and we offer encouragement when one of us gets way up there. \u00a0We laugh a lot, and we have a good time. For the beginners and others who read my first sentence and got this far, I say go for it! \u00a0Do it. \u00a0Break out of your inertia, or programming, or whatever it is that is holding you back. \u00a0There is no perfect time, do it now. \u00a0And since you got this far, let me praise some other things I like about Planet Granite. \u00a0I work out a lot, and I took advantage of having full run of this gym while I was a student (4 weeks). \u00a0I really like that there are no mirrors in the 1st floor area. \u00a0I guess your work out does in fact count even if you can't watch yourself, quick, go tell someone over at LA Fitness. \u00a0The selection of kettle bells, assorted weighted balls, dumbbells, etc is quite good. \u00a0I like the mats for my floor work - they are soft on my creaky spine. \u00a0It's a climbing gym, so the opportunities to hang are endless and I love them. \u00a0Finger board? \u00a0Of course. \u00a0Bars? \u00a0Everywhere. \u00a0There is a downside and that is crowding. \u00a0During the after work rush hour it gets tight in there. \u00a0If you can drop in during the day that is a win. \u00a0I was able to jump rope and do my thing without crowding anyone. \u00a0And a run on the treadmill doesn't feel like work when you can watch people climbing while you do it. They also have group classes, yoga, the usual. \u00a0I haven't had time to drop in on those but I am interested in a couple, such as Prehab - a program to improve stability and strengthen the core. \u00a0There is more to know. \u00a0Read more reviews. \u00a0Visit the website. \u00a0Drive by and yell encouragement at the Graniteers. \u00a0And if you have even a tiny feeling that you might want to try this, then you know what I say. \u00a0Do it!", "date": "10/3/2017"}, {"review_id": "9aOF7_HdXV6rvwrhOhoQPA", "user_id": "cSer36-jfM1hC223DFI1cg", "user_name": "Desiree C.", "business_id": "6hOQqQa5yK9son4ZKUKoFg", "stars": 5, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "LOVE this gym.

They require more strength and endurance instead. The holds and the walls are newer. They have a large weight training area. They have some higher walls, and a great spot to practice overhangs. The place is corporate feeling and the staff don't make much conversation. It's more expensive than PRG. They provide you with belay devices when top roping. I've successfully climbed 3 5.10cs here.At Portland Rock Gym, you'll find the routes to be a bit more intricate--they will require more technique and creativity, and you will rarely ever find yourself sprinting up the wall. They have auto-belays. The staff are warm and friendly, and it feels like you're supporting a local Portland business. I climb a pretty solid 5.9 here.So the two are fairly different.Planet Granite is great if you don't have a regular gym to go to. It's also great if you travel to the Bay Area since they have some other locations. The place is new, has a sauna, and is large and well lit.

I hear it's super popular in California and I was excited it was making its way up north. I have been drooling over the pictures and in awe of how enormous the gym seems. It's located downtown, but in a less crowded area, so you could still find some free parking if you look carefully.Upon walking in, you can sign your waivers and pay at the desk. You are greeted by the massive, tall walls where you can top rope and even do some lead climbing. What I really like about this facility is that there is a separate area to take the belay test. The places I've been to, it's just at a place where you can climb on the wall. There are sooo many routes that loop around into rooms with even more routes. I've climbed in Seattle at Stone and Vertical World and I must say the routes here are quite long. I got pooped after one! I like that the routes are numbered with which rope you are supposed to use. There's also a shorter wall for kids to climb with easier routes. I mostly boulder indoors and top rope outdoors, so I was impressed with the bouldering area. It's located upstairs. They have a pretty decent bouldering area with \"the wave\" that juts out where it's more overhung. I've noticed most of the walls have some sort of slope or curve to the wall to add dimension to your climb. There are some parts of the wall where it's completely vertical. There is also one top out boulder. The most exciting part of this area is the underhang part that has a 45 degrees incline. There are mats right below you so if you fall, it's not a long way down. SUPER fun spot. They also have a large area to work out in with several treadmills, weights, hang boards, etc. They also have more machines upstairs. Lots of variety to mix up your work out. I noticed that people come here primarily to top rope. They also don't change their bouldering routes that often. I noticed routes dating from when the opened and not many newer ones were put up. I don't know how their schedule works. Their selection of equipment (bags, carabiners, crash pads, helmets, etc) \u00a0is also impressive. It's comparable to online!

I have been tracking this place for almost a whole year, marking their progress and waiting for their doors to open. I am so excited to say that time has finally come!Following the footsteps of their amazing legacy gym from San Fran, they know exactly what they are doing... in fact, I think this is the company's 4th gym nationwide. They put a lot of time, money, and thought into every bit of construction of this fantastic place. They have weights, cardio equipment, 55 foot rock climbing walls, hundreds of bouldering problems, a yoga studio, a spin studio, and a sauna. There is definitely something for everyone in this world-class over 30,000 square foot gym!The managers and staff are so nice and so excited for this place to open just as much as the public. They had a couple preview nights for avid fans to sign up for memberships early and take a sneak peek of the place. It was jaw-dropping. I have climbed at one of the biggest gyms in the country (Earth Treks - Bethesda, MD), as well as a lot of smaller ones. This place is Grand, capital G, Grand! It's like the \"Equinox\" of CLIMBING gyms. The locker room walls are gorgeous, they might actually be made of granite. Tons of day lockers, several bathroom stalls, and individual showers. Towel service included! Just try to only use one and don't abuse the towel availability for everyone else, unless you need a clean one post-shower, before entering the sauna, then by all means keep hygienic. They also have these cool sink faucets with built in Dyson hand driers (yes there are paper towels available as well), but what I really appreciate is the built in lotion pumps by the sinks. Great for those post-climb dry hands. Brilliant foresight, thank you Planet Granite!!!They don't have their own parking deck which is a bummer, but there is a decent amount of street parking since it's more on the edge of the Pearl neighborhood bordering the still developing areas of Naito Pkwy. Short walk to park, or short walk from where the street car takes you and you should be okay. Their rates, relative to their spectacular-ness, are unbelievable. Right now, for a couples month-to-month membership (which is obviously what I got) is only $55 per person! That is RIDONK!!!!! Speaking of Equinox, high class gyms of any affinity usually are over $100 monthly memberships per person, so think of it that way! It's a sweet deal, in fact they could've charged more and we would've still done it. This place is sick, totally worth it! You can tell how much money went into the place with the exquisite route setting. They obviously had enough dough to shell out a plethora of holds so they could have all matching-colored holds, despite changing them around all the time, so they didn't have to fuss up their beautiful walls (signature 3D styles by Walltopia) with so many different colors of constantly-removed-and-replaced masking tape.I could go on and on about how much this place is (pun-intended) ROCKIN', but actually I'm afraid too many people will come and crowd me out... hehehe. Seriously though, I fear for PRG, they are so going to lose some business. Source should still be safe though cuz not all people want to drive over the bridge to climb. To each their own... me...

It's beautiful and it's for a relatively decent price (I have a student membership so I'm paying $54 a month)Membership perks: you get a guest pass every 2 months (it doesn't roll over so be sure to use it) but you can sign up to 2 friends a day to take a belay lesson for free! Belay lesson + day pass + rentals (shoes&harness) = 28 dollars originally but it's free if you have a member sign you up for the lesson. Definitely a great way to introduce climbing to your friends, without having them to pay. All they need to do is take the lesson for an hour and they're free to do whatever they want in the gym. I really like how the routes are all one single color and not labeled by colorful tape unlike the other gyms. I notice they change the top roping routes more often than the bouldering routes. I also notice the routes here are harder than the other gyms. A V1-2 here would be a V3 at one gyms. Great staff. Easy to point out, they all wear light blue t-shirts.

One of the difficult things to really pin down with gyms is an attention to routes. This means consistent route updates/changes, but also it goes beyond that. A good climbing gym has good route setters, and route setting is a mix of science and magic I think.So on top of the list above, which Planet Granite has nailed, they also have the route setting wizards.

Everything is so fresh, shiny and clean... because it's brand new. But still -- there are others ways you can tell that this is a great gym. For instance, they've got garage doors on the bottom AND top floors that will open in the summer to let fresh air in -- crucial for rock climbing gyms, since most tend to be in just barely-ventilated warehouses that heat up fast the higher you climb. And they've got a TON of other fitness equipment, all top of the line stuff like Rogue brand pull-up stations, Olympic bars, weights and even medicine balls for wall balls. It's wonderful. Also, they have towel service!!! The routes themselves are also well planned and more thought out than that of Portland Rock Gym. They use the Yosemite Decimal System to grade climbs with more granularity than PRG (Planet Granite does stuff like 5.10 A/B/C/D, whereas PRG only does 5.10+/-), and have a wealth of different grades. It's also definitely more beginner friendly, with a larger variety of easy routes (5.6-5.9) for those just starting out (in contrast, PRG only ever has 2 or 3 of those types of routes).The only downside is that it's super corporate. There's a surprising amount of red tape to go through before you can do anything. Signing up for the family plan with a partner means you have to show proof of the same address (or have the same last name), and you'll need proof of a current ID before you do anything else. Parking can also be a hassle.

Somehow their billing cycles can't accommodate this, so you have to pay until the end of the following month and then there's a process involving some forms and a voided check that will allow you out of the contract on the desired date.
