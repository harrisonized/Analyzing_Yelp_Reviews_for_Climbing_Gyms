The vibe and location is exceptional. The view from the suite was gorgeous. It was big and spacious with plenty of room but lacking adequate seating for our party of 5. Only a small desk in the corner of the master with 1 chair and 2 chairs on the balcony. While exploring the room the kids found a bunch of trash hidden behind the furniture, i.e. food packaging, empty cans of Red Bull, etc. No big deal, we dealt with it.I did have one major issue: access into and out of the suite.You see, I'm a high functioning quadriplegic that uses a wheelchair for mobility. (A pretty compact manual wheelchair because I'm not that big of a dude. (165 lbs.)) The entrance to the suite was a foyer, directly to a staircase. The only way for me to get into our suite was by an elevator that was located down around a corner of the building, through a lounge like hang out area, \u00a0in the back (or bottom) of the kitchen storage for the restuarant located on a lower level, which was blocked by crates of whatever. (If my wheelchair was a little wider, or if I was in a powerchair, I don't think I would have fit). Okay, not too bad, it was kinda fun rolling through a party seeing all the beautiful people imbibing on a gorgeous Southern California spring afternoon). Once in the elevator, it wouldn't go up! My wife had to go back up to the lobby and get help. After about 10 minutes, an engineer came because a key is needed to access the 3rd floor suite. (We were never made aware of that). The key didn't work, so as we waited inside the elevator, he went upstairs and called it up so we could get in the suite. We were told that going down would not be an issue. We spoke with the staff and they were very apologetic. I just decided to stay and enjoy the view from the suite while my family enjoyed the property and amenities because I didn't really feel like dealing with the elevator issue since we were only staying for one night. Inside the room was super spacious and the bathrooms were probably the most wheelchair friendly I have ever been in. The bed was extremely high and very difficult for me to get into. Definitely couldn't have gotten up by myself.When it came time to check out and leave, the elevator would not come up. WTF. (In my mind I'm thinking what would happen if there was an emergency and I had to get out quick?!) I was stuck. We called the front desk, they said they would send somebody. (Mind you, it was 11am, time to check out). After about 15 minutes, nobody came so my wife went up to the lobby. The front desk supervisor apologized and offered to comp us an extra hour in the suite. It was already 11:20 by that point. She emphasized that they never offer an extra hour for that suite. Hello! I am still stuck in the room!Shortly after that, the head engineer came up with the proper key for the elevator. He informed us that the elevator key should have been issued to us along with our room key at the time of check-in. UGH!Ultimately, they credited us the cost of our valet fee.I would definitely recommend this place to all of my able-bodied friends. My handicapped friends, not so much.", "date": "4/1/2019"}, {"review_id": "eVFgz7YBepcWXvv3taV-DQ", "user_id": "-CuYE3iVhRVep4qUviQaeg", "user_name": "Raychel R.", "business_id": "pPJLCarPr3kmvnV0OvmZYQ", "stars": 4, "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Not too shabby.

Something that confused me was that a random family was wondering if they could sit at the porch area and we explained that we paid for our space. So they sat at the porch next to ours but their kids decided to peek through the doors of our room. Not blaming the family or hotel here. But I'm assuming anyone can walk through the gates and walk through your doors so be careful of your belongings.They also have a inspector that comes in often to check if you brought in food or drinks. You're not allowed to and they will confiscate it. You will get it back by the end of the day. Food wise, everything was pretty good but it does take a while to come. Overall, great view and space.

That is what you're paying for. For those that leave reviews on it not being worth the price, that might be true anywhere else in the country but not here. Let me explain:California is expensive. Coastal cities, including Laguna Beach and others in Orange County, have some of the highest costs of living in the US. So while $300-$400 a night for a hotel is not small change, for a beachfront hotel in Southern CA, it's not the price of luxury. I repeat, this place is not luxurious. If you want glitz and resort-esque vibes, be prepared to find a place that'll easily set you back $600-$1000+ a night during high season. This hotel is as 3-star basic as they come and desperately needs some interior cosmetic updates. That being said, if you book the ocean view rooms, all of that can be overlooked as the beauty of the Pacific and its sunsets are the real charmer. We've stayed here in 2017 and this past June 2018. The reason was simply the location and views. The proximity to shops and restaurants is perfect. We walked and took Lyft/Uber or the free city trolley. I hear valet is expensive per day so we skip renting a car. We've had pleasant experiences with the front desk staff as well. It's likely those that are disappointed or letdown by the property itself might not have those same experiences/interactions. If you don't book an ocean view room, your view will be of Southern California's other prized possession - it's cars. Either South Coast Highway and its flow of traffic or the alleyway which is parking and valet galore. The bed is OK - definitely not pillow top. The carpet can use some cleaning. The bathroom could use some deep cleaning and the toiletries are simple. The air conditioner is loud but that's when it's best to have the direct breeze from the ocean - another reason to book an ocean front room! I seriously can't stress that enough. There is natural wear and tear that comes with being right on the water and one can only hope that they'll maintain it safely. I think this might be our last time staying here as we want to explore other CA beach towns in the future but I would recommend it if you're looking for the best location and can afford booking the nicer room option. If you have deeper pockets for a hotel, then go elsewhere.

The venue was beautiful and the food was great, but our hotel experience really did not measure up.Everything started out fine with the front desk allowing us to check in early. However, the key cards didn't work for practically the entire time we stayed there, which meant we had to keep calling and visiting the front desk, only for them to issue us more key cards that didn't work. This was extremely inconvenient, as we had vendors and family members helping us with the event who needed to be in and out of the suite quite often.The WORST part happened right before our wedding ceremony. We had to leave the door to the suite slightly ajar so that our photographer could come in without having to call us to open the door for her. When she and our friend/officiant entered the suite, they were met by two random guys at the foot of the stairs INSIDE THE SUITE. My friend reasonably asked them what they were doing there and if they were security, to which one of them coldly responded with \"don't I look like security, you Asian b*tch?\" That's right... this \"security guard,\" who never introduced himself to us and just let himself into our suite without permission made a RUDE and quite frankly RACIST remark toward a guest of the hotel just minutes before one of the most important moments of our lives. Then, when we were headed out to the ceremony, they just stared at us awkwardly by the doorway, refusing to move until my husband had to say \"ummm, we need to lock up right now.\"When I brought this incident up to our event coordinators, they said that it was unacceptable and that they would be escalating it to the hotel's general manager so they could review camera footage. I was told multiple times that hotel management would follow up with me. Well, it has been two weeks and I haven't heard a single thing from them, even after filling out their post-stay survey.

The woman who checked us in was very nice and upgraded us to a Queen Deluxe Room for free! The room service is expensive (they auto gratuity for you) i didn't know that lol.

This hotel is disappointing, it needs updating, cleaner facilities and rooms, and that's what the issue is. Plain and simple. Stop trying to market this as a luxury beach property and setting your guests up for disappointment- fix up a few things and own the charming old boutique hotel vibe!

We stayed here over New Years Weekend and had a great time with my family. The room was great, clean, comfy bed, awesome TV and chaise for my son to watch his cartoons on. The lobby as I checked in was nice, beachy feel with sofas to lounge on and relax. \u00a0All hotel staff was great, customer service at their finest. \u00a0My only complaint was the room had no microwave, they had refrigerators, coffee makers etc...but no microwave. \u00a0Ohhh...and the cloth shower curtain had the plastic protector missing.The hotel itself was nice but the Reef Bldg from the outside, may be due for some upgrades. (ie..... new paint on the walls and staircases down to the beach and going up to parking area.) \u00a0I understand you are a beachfront boutique hotel, you need to keep up with the competition and neighboring hotels. The $30 for the valet parking a night was a lil steep, but then again I cant forget we are in Laguna Beach. We enjoyed a great breakfast in the morning in our balcony the next morning. \u00a0We called for room service and food was delivered by Driftwood Kitchen on the premises of the hotel. The highlight was watching 3 dolphins frolic in the ocean that morning from the balcony.Food we enjoyed:Laguna Beach Omelette-Dungeness crab with goat cheese and avocado and side of potatoes. \u00a0Omelette was OK...crab was a lil strong a lil to fishy for my taste, Scrambled eggs with sausage, wheat toast and potatoes. \u00a0Not sure what type of sausage that was,,,but the best sausage I've ever had.I saved the French Toast for the last, because it was amazing. \u00a0It was crusted with granola and topped with caramelized hazelnut butter and raspberries, blueberries and strawberries.

We opened the door to rugged carpeting and I just felt like the price for the night was too high for such a small room that did not feel clean. The bathroom was white...off-white rather and the curtains were stained. The property features a pool and hot tub, which were both a couple of minutes away from our room in addition to a run-down gaming area. You could hear the music bumping from the nearby restaurants, the chatter from people next door, and pretty much anything else that generated sound.The staff was very nice and accommodating with parking, check in, check out.

I have been coming to Pacific Edge with my parents during summers since I was still in high school. I have experienced this hotel before all of the \"renovations\" and \u00a0\"upgrades\". My parents always opted for water front rooms and it really didn't even matter what the interior of the room looked like because I felt I was floating on top of the ocean when walking out on to the balcony. \u00a0They are also centrally located for access to shopping, dining, and a Ralph's grocery store right up the street. There are also two restaurants on site, The Deck and Driftwood. The views are nice, and The Deck is a good option for late night boozing. What annoyed me is the lack of hospitality by the staff. We decided to stroll in to Laguna on a Saturday night instead of Sunday. I called Pacific Edge to see if there was anything available for us to spend the night there and move to our reserved water front king the next day. After a long hold I was told everything was booked. I called Hotel Laguna who booked us a room at an extremely reasonable rate. It was nice knowing we had somewhere to crash once we arrived late in the evening. I should also mention that Hotel Laguna has a very reasonable noon check out time. Pacific Edge has a check out time of 11am and check in of 4pm.... 4pm! Hell, even Montage Laguna Beach has a noon check out time. Around 10am we called Pacific Edge to be put on the early check in list We were assured that we were in queue and would be contacted as soon as something becomes available.EVERY time I have requested early check in elsewhere, I have gotten it and this includes high end properties such as Montage and mid level properties such as La Casa del Camino. They may not have been immediate, but within an hour to two hours I would get a phone call that my room was ready.We decided to get a cocktail and a bite to eat at Watermarc while we wait and then walked around and did some shopping. By 3pm I was exhausted and told my husband we should just come back and see what the status is. When we arrived, it looked like there was a shift change and different people were there. We gave the friendly clerk our information and he informed us that indeed our room was ready. THANKS FOR COMMUNICATING THIS TO US! Great job by your staff. When I called to check if late check out was available, guess what the answer was? A big, fat, NOPE!We took our car down to the valet for the $27 per day parking charge. The room was fine. It had the basic necessities and a nice big bed. The view is unsurpassed and what made the annoyances worth it. Their village rooms are not worth the price, so unless you're willing to splurge $400 a night with parking for the water front room, go elsewhere.We did get the little $10 plush seal to save the seals, plus I thought it was something cute to bring back to my daughter. Now that I reflect on it, even that was a rip off. The complete lack of accountability and unwillingness to accommodate a patron of over 10 years calls for a break up. Plus, Laguna is really not at a shortrage of beautiful ocean front properties.TO CLARIFY:I understand it is difficult to accommodate every guest's request. MY gripe was with the fact that when we showed up at 3PM.. our room was already ready! NO ONE CALLED US AS PROMISED.

Anyone could walk right in since the door led to the main sidewalk. Bizarre! If you want fresh air, anyone walking by can head right on in to your room, or have a full eyeful of your naked body sprawled on the bed.7. No room service to speak of. If there was any, we could not find it.8. Dilapidated grounds with no upkeep.9. Lumpy beds that cave in the middle and smell like human body odor 10. The only fresh-air source is the small window that opened above the alley above the trash cans (and this wasn't the only horrible room in the place; all of our friends reported similar issues)11. Slimy tub floor without stick guard; my wife slipped and nearly killed herself while shaving her legs12. No drainage in either the sink or the tub. Nothing better than showering in knee-deep murky water filled with someone else's hairs!13. Unaffected office staff when we complained. One actually said, \"Our owners don't care, so why should we?\" Wow. Just...WOW14. Overpriced. Winter rooms $389. I get that for summer...possibly. But who wants to go on the beach when it's storming outside? Winter prices should have been adjusted accordingly, and also considered the mold, smell, safety, and trash issues. Disgust should not be the prevailing emotion when on vacation. You make the Motel 6 look good. At least Motel 6 is clean!15. A bias against Asians. No Asian decor or food items to reflect cultural diversity. But then again, that may be MY bias. The rest of the review is unbiased.In conclusion, if you don't mind spending top dollar for a dirty hole, then this is your place!UPDATE: This is my response to the manager who contacted me. My review stands.Hello Alex,I can assure you that I'm not \"claiming\" these events happened because trust me, they actually did. Nor am I trying to get a free room because I will never stay at your skanky, disgusting hotel again. You couldn't pay me to! Ten people in our party had the same awful experience. Dirty towels, feces smears on the walls, mold, trash smell outside windows, smelly beds, dirty carpets, ankle-deep in dirty tub water that didn't drain, foul stench in all the rooms, and poor customer service. I suggest you look into managing your maid service, updating your dilapidated hotel rooms, and thinking about what a customer might experience at your slovenly establishment when they are there on business or for a romantic getaway. Obviously, the owners don't care about their clients or their experience. This hotel is clearly designed to rip off the unsuspecting tourist. It's obviously just a cash cow for the owners and nothing else. What about pride of ownership and the client's experience? What about how a hotel guest might feel when they have to pay for such a terrible experience when they were expecting a getaway from the difficulties of life? What about females who stay there and need fresh-air ventilation in your stuffy rooms but can't get fresh air unless they open patio doors onto the main walkway where transients and maintenance people and strangers walk by? What about the embarrassment that business people have when their clients realize what kind of rathole they're staying in? \u00a0I'm sorry you work for this company and have to do damage control for them. It must be a hard job. Anyway, thanks for reaching out, but nothing can undo what took years in the making. A hotel that poorly run doesn't just happen overnight or with one person. Best of luck to you.ChenPS--My Asian decor comment was in jest. I know your hotel is going for the beachy look and vibe. (And, obviously, the moldy look and vibe, too).", "date": "11/25/2017"}, {"review_id": "ITdUAI4SkyIC8d6IO29LjA", "user_id": "iRV-8lU2HFJnqLnj8rwwYw", "user_name": "Ivana M.", "business_id": "pPJLCarPr3kmvnV0OvmZYQ", "stars": 5, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Chose this place for a business meeting my fiancee and i had.

Stay away. The rooms all on the Bahia side are old, the decor is old and stained, the kitchens are not remodeled with dirty grout. And particularly- Bahia room 14 on the third floor, the toilet seat doesn't match the toilet, it's too small.We paid a lot of money for this room and none of the Bahia rooms have king size beds. The indoor/outdoor carpets on the balconies are stained. The kitchens are not clean with coffee stains on the counter tops and dirt on top of the refrigerators.. And unless you are on third floor you barely get an ocean view.. And if your on the bottom floors you get the stinky fish /seafood smell from the restaurants across your balconies with a view of the valet guys running back and forth and the smokers outside the Driftwood Restaurant. Nice... so not..The showers are awful, the shower heads are horrible. The water comes out like misty rain with a dirty flimsy cloth curtain with dirty grout tiles. And the rickety scary elevator that takes forever is better than walking up and down the dirty small stairs. The only good thing is the valet and bell desk guys were very nice and helpful. And don't waste your time eating at the Driftwood Kitchen across the way. They try to make the food fancy and it's too salty and the drinks were not good either.. My suggestion is to book across the street to 14 West Boutique hotel. They have small kitchenettes but with clean modern rooms. You don't have a view of the ocean but you have a nice clean new room!Thomas:Yes, we told the front desk that we were not happy and unfortunately they were booked that weekend. The best they could do was move us to the third floor, Bahia #14, on our last night there where we could see a glimpse of ocean view. But my fianc\u00e9e is 6'3 and to have only queen beds on that side of the hotel is ridiculous. We specifically asked for a king size bed when we booked the room. The room they moved us to was slightly better than the first floor room. Except Bahia #14 has an older kitchen then the \u00a0Bahia #2 first floor room.

I've stayed in many a beach hotel and they are quite a task to upkeep, so while the Ritz Carlton on Amelia Island definitely set the bar high for beach hotels, I have tempered expectations when making plans to temporarily live at the beach. Check in was a breeze. Bryan was super helpful and was able to upgrade our room (we're Joy of Life club members) which made the kickoff to our anniversary vacation that much better. They're a valet only establishment. They do give you the option to park somewhere along PCH, but considering I was in a rental and I'm not the most experienced parallel parker, valet it was! The valets were quick every time we needed access to our car. \u00a0The room was quite warm, but considering the blazing sun and the abnormally warm winter SoCal had been having I wasn't too shocked. Open the doors, turn on the AC unit and wait for the sun to go down.

It would switch between hot & cold, but if you tried to correct it, it went too far. Towards the end of our stay, I got used to it and it was just an added 'quirk' of our stay.Typically I judge a hotel by whether or not I would come back. I would come back to Pacific Edge, but it wouldn't be my first choice. A lot of that, however, has to do with it's location.

We booked a few weeks in advance, chose the standard room. We arrived and checked in at about 2PM. There is parking for check in (for permanent parking read further) just off PCH... Check in was easy. We were advised of the hotel amenities and how to park. For parking, you get back in the car and go around the block where the Valet is located. Its the only option and its $27 per day. There is no other parking in the area so plan for this. You can then leave your car and walk the town or take an Uber, we did both and both were easy. The hotel comprises a large piece of land between PCH and the beach.... Therefore, many of the rooms are literally on the sand. You can walk right down and there is a little foot shower for your dirty toes. The room was a standard room. I would have chosen the view room next time, they appeared much larger and had the view. We were in a closet sized room with a Queen bed. A dresser, two night stands, closet, wall mounted TV (to the right of the bed, hard to turn your neck to watch it) and a bathroom the size of a shoebox. You won't be taking your toiletries out on this sink! The bathroom was terrible. The rooms had been \"remodeled\" in the Surf and Reef wings. We were in Surf room 75. The bathroom had a modern toilet and sink/vanity but the shower was so old. Old tub with large chips, scuffs, dirt and mildew. The white tile above it on the walls had been re-caulked about a hundred too many times. There were cracks, scuffs, stains and hair on the tile. There was hair in the soap dish too. Yuck. The carpet was newer in the room but was stained from what appeared to be burn marks even though its non smoking. The room smelled a little like a cigarette... BUT! The AC worked WELL. Much needed given the heat wave Laguna was experiencing. Some of the old hotels don't have AC. Yuck. The bed was very comfortable. Pillows were foam, I like those unlike the newer down pillows that don't support anything. There is no breakfast but two restaurants on the property make up for that. They have free towels, chairs, lounges and umbrellas at the beach. So nice. Just walk down and two nice guys set up everything for you. The water immediately in front of the hotel had a \u00a0ton of kelp in it. Just several hundred feet away the water was clear. Maybe its not always like this? Mostly kids in it.

There aren't enough chairs or towels for all the guests which is surprising for a hotel with high room rates. The rooms are not clean, my shower curtain had someone's hair on it when we checked in and bugs in the bathtub.

When we checked in I was very clear that my purchase was with Groupon and thought I made sure \"they weren't going to charge me again.\" The lady that checked us in said she saw our reservation. (Days later, once I saw charges, I realized she never asked me for my Groupon confirmation number.) On Sunday I saw 2 charges pending. I immediately called and spoke to the front desk who gave me an email address to forward my Groupon confirmation so they could look into it. He said my email would go to the front desk and it would be looked at. He wasn't very assuring when he told me they \"hadn't had a Groupon promotion in 2 years\" and wasn't sure how I could have booked through Groupon :/ 2hrs later I had not received a reply confirming they had received my email. So I called to followed up to make sure someone got my email. I was told everyone was gone for the evening and that my email was forwarded to a manager, who would look at it the next day. The next day, all day went by and I had not received a reply or call back. I called after work and asked to speak to a manager. The front desk told me the manager was gone for the day, but pulled up my account and said it had notes that it had been reviewed and I was going to be credited back. Now, why couldn't they have been pro-active with great customer service and at lest emailed me back on Sunday or Monday following up on my concern. Anyway, we'll see in a few days if the full amount, minus parking, gets credited back. I hope to see this credit before Friday, which I was told I may not see it until then.", "date": "5/5/2015"}, {"review_id": "i5Z5NhNbtgi1-wxCn3_HLg", "user_id": "8KIoCbJWQm5TY5JNTEsYRg", "user_name": "Art L.", "business_id": "pPJLCarPr3kmvnV0OvmZYQ", "stars": 5, "useful": 1, "funny": 2, "cool": 1, "text": "Stayed here for the Pageant of the Masters, we were able to walk to the venue on nice quiet back roads, totally worth it. \u00a0 \u00a0Get one of the ocean facing units, the view is awesome, waves literally lapping up to the building below your balcony. \u00a0 Went body surfing at 1am, watched surfers and the sunset from the balcony. \u00a0There is a Ralphs grocery store within walking distance, if you want to stock up on victuals and vino. \u00a0Also get yourself some wasteful single-cup refills for the Keurig coffee machine in your room. \u00a0 The room itself was nice but not 5 stars. \u00a0It was quite pricey due to the location and season, but worth it for an overnight splurge. \u00a0Front desk staff was efficient and helpful at check-in and out, other than that didn't need to see or speak to them.", "date": "7/21/2015"}, {"review_id": "iHGu8K3tdCe7A9xHzANJqg", "user_id": "YvUekj1oPvfdE7ynlW5cVA", "user_name": "Debra P.", "business_id": "pPJLCarPr3kmvnV0OvmZYQ", "stars": 1, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "We are from Las Vegas, in California to celebrate a 50 year HS reunion.

Didn't touch any hotel amenities. Wasn't my first choice for a hotel room, and won't be my first choice next time I need a hotel.

Also, on the top, (4th), floor, the only window in the place had no screen. The patio door did not lead to a balcony, but to the open hallway outside the room. The only positive to even having a patio door, was it sort of made the room look large enough to move around.

I don't travel often but will run the range of budget motel to luxurious hotel and will always be fair in my expectations based on how much I'm willing to pay. I paid for a three star hotel and received two stars (at best). I strongly recommend Hotel Laguna as it is a few blocks away, cheaper, and much nicer.It started off badly as soon as we pulled into the hotel parking lot. The mandatory parking fee of $30 is excessive as many other reviewers have mentioned even for Laguna Beach. \u00a0Hotel management will comment that you have other options (metered parking on the street for example), but traffic is horrible here and parking is few and far between. Also, tourists not familiar with the area (like my wife and I) don't want to run the risk of tickets or getting our vehicle towed. I can understand charging fees of a few bucks to $20 (like other hotels) but be reasonable. The worst part is that you have to valet. Why must I turn over my keys to a stranger to park my car? I will gladly park in any designated spot the staff directs me to. Don't you think it's good practice to give guests reasonable accommodations? Also, my hesitation for valet is for good reason.The valet staff lacked professionalism and overall good customer service. Upon arrival, they look like a bunch of college kids gathered around a podium playing games or texting on their phones. Hotel guests (including myself) had to tap one of them on the shoulder to get service. No greeting or paying attention to guests around them - too busy on their smart phones. While I understand that the valet staff is a third party (not affiliated with the hotel) it will reflect on the hotel itself since this is the opening experience (and a bad one). The very next morning when my wife and I passed by the valet stand on our way to breakfast, one customer was standing around waiting for the only attendant currently on duty to bring his car around. No problem there except I noticed ALL THE CAR KEYS were clearly visible and unattended!!! Basically, the valet forgot to lock the key case, so for over five minutes anyone could have grabbed a bunch of keys and took off. Very nice - this is why I don't valet.Checking in to the room is in itself a poor experience. The carpeting leading down the dark hallways is disgusting. The elevator that we needed to take (my wife has knee problems and cannot use stairs easily) looked very poorly maintained as it squeaked and shook excessively while in use (very unnerving). The room itself is roomy but very outdated. I found the room to be on the same level with as a Motel 6 not a three star hotel. Why? Read on.Nothing fancy about the room but a major complaint being the old and stained carpeting. The stove was also old, but I can't speak to its functionality since i did not want to use it. The small refrigerator was fine though. The bed and linens were clean and comfortable (to be fair). The bathroom was poor though. It was the size of a closet! I don't know why the hotel room was so large and yet in the bathroom you cannot take more than one step in any direction without bumping into the sink, toilet, or bathtub. It was beyond cramped! The fixtures looked thrown together at the last minute, and the ground did not feel level. The bathtub was okay but the shower head was old and covered in disgusting grime/mildew. In taking a shower, the fixtures had a mind of its own since it would randomly switch between hot and cold on its own. Not goodWhen my wife and I left early morning 8:00am to check out the beach and shops we expected to return to a clean room with fresh linen and towels (a.k.a. room service). We wanted to take a quick shower and short nap to recharge for a night out on the town. In getting back to our room after 4:00pm there was no room service yet!! The hotel had over eight hours to clean up our room! I've been to cheap $60/night cheap motels (bigger than this one) that cleaned my room late morning/early afternoon. This is not unreasonable and is a fair expectation. The maid came by fifteen minutes later but hours too late. The worst part about the room is that the walls are paper thin, and we had a hollow door (or just a very cheap one) that separated the neighboring hotel room. Basically, after just a few minutes of settling in we heard (loud and clear) our neighbors every conversation! We first though there were other people in our room! A part of the neighbor's conversation was private and I'm sure he would not have been happy to know that a stranger was able to hear his every word (even though I tried not to). \u00a0Keep this in mind **WARNING** that you might be by the beach, but don't expect privacy if you don't keep your conversations at whisper level.

Right on the water. The reef building is where to stay if you want to get your money's worth. So we decided to extend our stay through the weekend. The new room we were given was sub par.

To say the least, I was extremely disappointed. No heater, hot shower broke into cold in the middle of my bathing, the iron stopped working in the middle of my ironing, super loud air conditioning unit that has an option for heat, but it does not work, the swimming pool is freezing cold, but even if it wasn't, the ambiance is little to be spoken of, likened to that of a cheap apartment complex. And last, be sure to bring your own power strip because, although there are many power outlets, all of them are being used by the amenities in the room such as the lamp, TV, Icebox, Air conditioner, clock, phone, Coffee maker, which stop working in the middle of making coffee by the way. All of these things, and this was the better room. I asked for an upgrade because the first room I was originally assigned to had an awful mildew smell, the carpet was extremely dirty, and was muggy and wet.The windows were dirty and did not work properly, the room was very old and dirty feeling, the bathtub knobs were nasty, old, and full of soap scum. I absolutely hated my stay at this hotel and I am not even that picky. The spirit of the hotel is like they give you just enough, no more, but a little less. Almost as if to say, \"Look, you're by the beach in the downtown area, stop being picky, shut up, and enjoy the outdoors, you're not supposed to be spending much time in the room anyway.\"So BUYER BEWARE!!!!! Even if you come and ask to see the room first, which I did, but was shown one of the Ocean fronts, which impressed me, so I booked right away, thinking all the rooms had somewhat of the same spirit. I knew I was downgrading by not getting an Ocean front, but did not realize the downgrade meant a low grade. Also, I noticed management replies to some of the previous reviews, which apologized, but never offered to make amends by returning some of the cost for all of the inconvenience, just the typical, \"Oh we are so sorry that we did not meet your expectations.\" but please believe me when I tell you, I am a very simple person, not hard to please, and easy to be content; but bad smells, broken appliances, and un-kept surroundings are unacceptable from a hotel that charges an upwards of hundreds per night. All I could say is to make sure to get a tour first, and not of an Ocean Front unless that is the room you will be purchasing. To get the true spirit of the hotel, get a tour of a regular room, one by the pool that has the Jacuzzi, and I guarantee, you will be having second thoughts.

Short story: the valet took my Lexus convertible for an 80 mile joy ride. Long story: we needed to leave early in the morning, we woke up and were ready to go by 8 o'clock. We gave our valet ticket to the front desk at check-out and waited...they brought up someone else's car. We informed them that it was not our car, and gave a description of our car. They told us that we were at fault for giving them the wrong valet ticket as if we had more than one - the one they gave us when we dropped off the car. After searching for our car for 15 minutes, we decided to go help search. We discovere that our car was there, but they had \"lost\" the keys. The valet on hand at the time, Drew, blamed us saying that we must have taken the car out the previous night. We were very clear that we never took our car out from the moment we dropped it at valet. Drew asked us to wait until 9:00 to speak to his manager, Jordan, who he had on the phone. When we asked to speak to his manager Jordan, he refused to allow us to speak to him. After throwing a hissy fit, Drew called Jordan back and spoke to him furtively around the corner - then he allowed us to speak to Jordan. Jordan again asked us to wait until 9:00 to resolve the matter - we didn't see how waiting would make our key magically appear especially given our time constraints. After promising to get us a cab, we went to wait for the cab. We waited quite a while...until 9:10 am at which point Drew showed up with our car keys - acting as if he had miraculously found them. When we asked where he found them, he would not disclose that information. We were so happy to have our keys that we just decided to leave - considering we were an hour behind our scheduled departure. When we turned our car on, we noticed that our gas tank was above the full mark - when we arrived at the hotel it was half full. Additionally, we had just taken note of the milage the day we dropped the car off and were able to calculate that the valet had put an additional 80 miles on our car. When confronted, they gave us blank stares. The hotel itself is not the cleanest, it is not exactly what it appears to be online. They only provide you with 2 towels, mediocre service, and the rooms are on an alleyway right above the valet station so you listen to people picking up their cars all night long while trying to sleep.

Per my review below before arriving I was nervous about our stay. But once I got there my mind was put at ease. -Oceanfront Room in the Reef building. the view- WOW. I mean, it seriously cannot get any better. My first time in Laguna Beach and I totally fell in love with this area. The water is beautiful - and being able to hear the crashing waves from your room was incredible. We watched the sunset from our balcony/ drinking wine and it was very memorable. I wanted to freeze time. I can't speak for the other rooms but I truly think this is the way to go. So worth it. -The room was upgraded - and I liked the touches added. Again, the property is not \"new\" - it is older and renovated and knowing that, I felt accommodations were comfortable, clean & maintained. So you need to come in with the right expectations.-The staff is all very helpful & friendly -The private beach area is nice where they provide beach towels and chairs, it was fun watching the surfers-I loved that it is walking distance to all the shops. We went for a stroll in the evening, there is a Ralph's & Whole Foods close by. The hotel partners with certain shops and we got a discount from Quiksilver because we were staying at Pacific Edge. Awesome!-Ate at Driftwood and it was all very delicious. Didn't get a chance to try the Deck. But both restaurants are also on the water. -The decor was cute & beachy. Overall, I would def. stay here again!Will be there next week - and hoping to increase the rating. There are mixed reviews on here - so I am a bit apprehensive but also hopeful! \u00a0My husband and I have never been to Laguna Beach - this is our first time, so seeing the area and accommodations with fresh eyes! The oceanfront room really looked like the way to go so we are staying in on of those. (reef building, i believe). I was tossed up with which building because from traveler's photos the surf rooms looked more modern/better upgraded but they are closer to the restaurant and over the bungalows so possibly more noise...hopefully the Reef rooms have the same upgraded touches and also from what I read, crossing fingers our room is renovated.

We spent a week-end in Room 12, the two-bedroom apartment. The service at the front desk was incompetent (though pleasant) and the room looked like a run down Frat House. The worst aspect was the unsanitary condition of the unit.We arrived at 3pm, an hour before check-in. We were told they would put a \"rush\" on the cleaning of our room and call us when it was ready. 1 1/2 hours and 6 phone calls later, we finally entered Room 12. What a disaster!The following issues were immediately apparent (photos attached):1. \u00a0 Greasy finger/handprints on walls and window frames.2. \u00a0 Excessive chipped paint on walls.3. \u00a0 Front door & frame w/chipped paint, jimmied frame plate, dented lock plate, flimsy lock.4. \u00a0 Wall w/a BIG cut out of sheet rock that was completely unsealed.5. \u00a0 Bathtub w/a quarter size chip in enamel......black and rusted. 6. \u00a0 Washed bath towel w/blood stain.7. \u00a0 Carpet pulled up and frayed in corners of rooms. 8. \u00a0 Small, medium and large stains on carpet throughout unit.9. \u00a0 Doors missing from closet in the bedroom w/2 twin beds.10. Filthy & scuffed white dresser is same room.11. Sofa in living room w/a huge tear in the upholstery on one arm. 12. Peeling and shredding outdoor carpet on balcony.13. Completely rusted air-conditioning unit on balcony/deck visible from inside.14. Pillows did not have liners under the pillowcases. My family is allergic to down pillows. When I removed the pillow case from a pillow in order to find the \"materials\" tag, I discovered a nauseating black stain that covered the entire corner of the pillow. I then removed the case from another pillow, and discovered mold. Once again, I called the front desk, explained about our allergies to down, and specifically requested four poly or cotton-fill pillows. It was like the people at the front desk did not process spoken language. The response, \"I'll see what security can do.\" 10 minutes later, a security patrol showed up at our door with 3 pillows; only ONE was not down. Needless to say, we slept w/out pillows.15. \u00a0Valet area is also used as a SMOKING AREA.*16. The straw that broke the proverbial camel's back: While carrying my luggage into the bedroom w/the queen bed, barefoot, I stepped in the area between the end of the bed and dresser, and felt a pinch on the bottom of my foot. When I looked down and lifted up my foot, I saw that I had stepped on a man's large TOENAIL.....Absolutely disgusting!!!When I called the hotel directly to make the reservations, I should have been told about the location of the unit:1. \u00a0 The balcony and one bedroom directly overlook the valet area. From morning until evening, we listened to the constant stream of car engines, opening and slamming of car doors, and voices (many intoxicated or on cell phones) generated from the VALET SERVICE.2. \u00a0 \u00a0The balcony and one bedroom also overlook a swimming pool. At one point in the afternoon, there were 17 teenagers (I counted) in the spa, and a group of intoxicated young women celebrating what looked to be a bachelorette week-end. 3. \u00a0 The balcony and one bedroom also overlook the roof of the Driftwood Kitchen restaurant, including the up-drafts from inside the kitchen. From the time the restaurant opened in the morning until closing at night, we smelled every dish cooked in the kitchen, from bacon to fish, coming from the updrafts. 4. \u00a0 Throughout the day and evening, the smell of people taking their smoking breaks near the Valet area was added to the food aromas. So much for the sounds and smells of the fresh salty ocean and breeze! This hotel is part of the Joie de Vivre Hotel Chain. I've been a JdV member for almost 10 years.

Maybe because we got the deal on travel zoo, that the people that stayed there weren't the classiest or considerate of their neighbors. \u00a0Or could it be the expectations are not too high here. \u00a0During checkout the front desk did take care of our extra taxes and said we could keep our car there longer. \u00a0This gave back an extra 1/2 star rating...In the end we were happier to leave the hotel and find a nice quiet beach with out the vacuum VROOM, VROOM noises, kids running around, \u00a0and smoke on the beach. \u00a0You can't compare this to a top notch hotel. \u00a0SO don't expect a lot. \u00a0I would however expect 3 strikes and you're out. \u00a0If a guest calls at least 3 times for 3 different valid reasons, some excellent quality service should have taken place - breakfast, upgrade, or something that shows \"our standards are higher than what you have experienced.\" \u00a0Then maybe this review would've been a bit different. \u00a0I've stayed at many hotels - high end to bed and breakfast places - so I do have experience in this field. \u00a0This is not a quiet, secluded beach hotel, like the Surf and Sand Resort. \u00a0There is no comparison. \u00a0I spent my summers at this hotel growing up and was excited to try a new beach hotel in close proximity. \u00a0TIPS - if you do stay here - ask for a room closest to the beach and away from the street. \u00a0Check that everything is working in the room. \u00a0On the beach, try to go as far away from the rooms as possible, so you won't be bothered with cleaners and maintenance noises. Pools are not the best. \u00a0Don't expect a good night's rest. \u00a0Good luck!TIPS for hotel - serve cold refreshing water on the beach, not just the lobby. \u00a0Try to accommodate the rooms as best as possible, to an enjoyable stay if you have lots of rooms available, then a room closer to the beach would be more enjoyable. \u00a0Be aware of the noise level and let other workers keep it down - valet crew, maintenance, to even guest. \u00a0When a guest calls and complains about different occurrences, it would be a good idea to try and please them. \u00a0Would I stay here again? \u00a0I don't know- I don't like feeling like crap the next day due to lack of sleep from outside noises. \u00a0This would be my number one annoyance.", "date": "3/31/2014"}, {"review_id": "FccE43je09b1yZrioB1ksQ", "user_id": "GXLf35Nfwc-BSMrlgTR7LA", "user_name": "Rick A.", "business_id": "pPJLCarPr3kmvnV0OvmZYQ", "stars": 4, "useful": 0, "funny": 1, "cool": 0, "text": "Surprised at all the terrible reviews of this place.

We read that they were pet friendly so it was decided we'd take our dog with us for this overnight getaway. \u00a0Well online a statement from their manager says \" Pets do have to be placed in a kennel if left alone in the room for the safety of the pet as well as the owner.\" \u00a0So we brought a crate with us. \u00a0But when you get there they say that you can't leave your pet unattended at any time. \u00a0This really conflicts with each other! \u00a0It even says on the statement they make you sign that if your pet is noisy YOU have to pay for the rooms of people that might complain or something scary like that. \u00a0Because of this, we didn't know what to do. \u00a0They did have some information about pet sitting, which we tried, but since we didn't know about this until we got there there was no hope of getting anyone to come by on short notice. In the end we ended up taking our dog home (luckily this was just a getaway weekend and we were within an hour of home and could do this). \u00a0I really think they need to put this policy on their website and not have conflicting policies online. \u00a0I wasn't about to pay for my neighbors' room in case my dog whined a bit when we left. \u00a0I mean I understand if she was barking or crazy noisy but that policy left it open to who knows what. The other problem was the shower. \u00a0It does that rotating temperature \"feature\" (haha) where it goes all the sudden cold and then back to hot. \u00a0This can be kind of dangerous because when it goes cold you tend to turn the knob to hot more, and then it comes back and you practically get burned. The elevator in our building was a little freaky too. \u00a0You feel like it's not moving and at least twice I thought I was stuck in the elevator and then all the sudden the door opens. Valet parking is $20 a night, but they say that upfront so I was prepared. \u00a0You do have \"in/out\" privileges so that was OK.

They have valet parking and allow you easy access to your car during their business hours.So really the main issue with this place is the rooms, even though they were able to offer a view of the water from my room, the room itself needs work done and lots of updating. The paint color, was uuuggghh, dull yellows and bright blues with ugly floral patterns. The bathroom needed some major updating as well, idk what \"decor\" the mirror was supposed to have, but it just looked more like cracked, stained glass? tile was falling off under the sink and the cabinet doors and drawers were also broken and slightly falling off as well. I've slept in waaay comfier beds before too and rooms that felt a lot cleaner. Small tv, which yes I understand the beach is outside, so why would I care about the tv size.. I still like to enjoy a movie while hanging out late at night.

We arrived on a Thursday 09/03/2015. The next day 09/03/15, when I went to the front desk to get some change and my car; the clerk, Mathew, called the valet guy, Santos, who took a long time, because he didn't have his Walky Talky in hand to be reached. Needless to say this delayed us a bit. Anyhow, it was really early, we are running a bit behind so we left. When we arrived to Dana Point; I realize I didn't have my key because when I turn off the car and tried to turn it back on, it didn't and the dash board showed NO KEY. I drive a keyless G37 2013 Infinity, which you can actually drive without a key. I called the front desk clerk at the Edge Water Hotel 4 times to ask him to PLEASE contact the valet guy for my keys. The 1st 3 times I called this guy Mathew kept on asking me what was the matter. By the 4th time, They told me the keys were given to my friend who was actually standing by the front of the hotel. I asked my friend whom I have j own for 20 years and he told me the valet guy NEVER gave me any keys. By this time, other people in our crew started to take everything out of my car to find the damn key. There was no key in my car. So, my friend and I told the rest of the group to go on with out us, as I could not leave my car unattended with the window down for 12 hours. So we TOTALLY missed out on our trip I planned for weeks. Took a taxi back to the hotel. Nobody had a clue about anything. I spoke to the valet guy Santos and he told me he gave the key to my friend. I asked him how come he didn't give it to me since I was the one driving, and his reply was that because he was getting in the passenger seat he figured it was ok to do so. Not cool, I have never experienced this when the valet gives the key to the passenger, it is ALWAYS given to me. Anyhow, I went to complain again and the kids at the front desk made me go over the entire situation again as the other kid, Mathew, who was well aware of everything didn't care to report the issue to his peers. I'm frustrated and still no answers. So I went to my room to shower, and the valet guy Santos knocked on our room door and my friend opened the door. Santos went to tell him that the car would have made a noise if we were to drive away from the key, however, the car was already running when I got into it. Then Santos went to tell him he gave him the key, and my friend told him he was out of line saying that as he didn't he ANY key from him. After I showered, I went back out side and decide to walk up and down PCH to see if in deed the key was place somewhere on the hood or roof. I found nothing. Totally frustrated at the waste of time, energy and money; I went back to the hotel to ask the kids again what to do. Everyone washed their hands and turned me on to some guy named Miles whom I have never met before. Miles is the owner of the valet service. He was really nice, and told me that his employee swears he gave us the key. He offered to pay for uber to go back to my car and search for the keys again, so before I left, I asked the kids at the front desk to check on the video recorded while this incident happened between 4:00 am and 4:25 am. Some young lady told me she would take care of reviewing the video and after 20 minutes of me waiting she came back to tell me their cameras didn't reach the FRONT OF THE HOTEL \u00a0so they couldn't tell. So at this point is our word agains their valet guy's word who never handed me my key. So, I figured the staff at this hotel nor the owner of the valet service were going to accommodate me for the lost key and so I called my wife who would have to drive an hour from our home to bring me my spare key. I also had to request from one of the kids at this hotel to give me some sort of form to file this incident. What I find funny is that no one offered it to me before and I actually had to requested. Very strange. Later, I decided to go back to Dana Point, paid my own uber, stripped my car again and found nothing. Called the valet service owner and ask him what to do. He said he would try to get me a key through his insurance but it would be very unlikely to do so. WOW! What to do? My poor wife finally arrived, gave me the spare key and my friend and I proceeded to test it out and see if in deed the car made any noise or signal as we drove away from the key. So I stabbed my key, started the car, gave the key to my friend who was standing outside the car, a small two beep noise went off and then I proceeded to drive away and there was no other warning. We tried this 3 different times. So obviously we are pretty pist off at this time because we realize my key in deed was NEVER given to me. Call the Miles guy again. He called me back left a message and told me he called \u00a0my dealership and blah blah and the car should of made some sort of sound or signal.", "date": "9/6/2015"}, {"review_id": "9DJ8BUnPmRrq40_uLBSC9A", "user_id": "hem7ZHa4Mz_m4x0qIMCynA", "user_name": "Steve T.", "business_id": "pPJLCarPr3kmvnV0OvmZYQ", "stars": 2, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Not really worth my money and time.

I got there on a holiday when the meters weren't enforced and set my alarm for 7:30 a.m \u00a0the following morning and put in 3 bucks to cover me from 8 a.m. - 11 a.m. (check out time). \u00a0My other complaint is I found the mattress uncomfortable. \u00a0I know this is just a personal preference but I slept horribly even with the ocean in the background.. \u00a0Woke up with a backache the following morning.. \u00a0Overall I had a good stay (was just there one night) but not sure I would have paid full price for the room.", "date": "9/10/2011"}, {"review_id": "WKm3ZYExSTGsRA7BGD_wvQ", "user_id": "lCHrWsDVpI2WMQQx2kSCNg", "user_name": "D.

So much so that we plan on coming back as much as we can. Everyone one that worked there during our stay from the front desk people to the beach guys were super friendly and really went out of there way to help you. The view of the ocean and the coast line from The Pacific Edge is incredible. If you stay in the reef tower the waves come all the way up to the building during high tide. You can look straight down from your balcony and see the surf. That being said we did have a few minor bumps in our stay. First off a few days before we arrived my wife called with some questions and the girl that answered the phone was really rude and short with her. When we got there and checked in we went to valet to park the car and have our stuff brought to the room. We had some fragile decorations for the wedding in a box and told the valet guy about it. So he proceeds to put that box on the bottom of the valet cart and pile all of our stuff on top of it. Then about half way to our room he ends up dumping all of our stuff off the cart. Not a good way to start our stay. When we booked our room we requested a low room but we got there they had given us one on the top floor. Also the pics of the room we got showed a full size refrigerator. We were bringing up some perishables for the wedding and were counting on have that full size fridge. The fridge that was in our room was a mini fridge . We ended up getting everything into the mini one so I guess it all worked out. Next the way the building is designed your next door neighbor's AC \u00a0sticks out onto your patio. So when they run it it blows hot air on you when you sit out on your patio. Also the condensation from the AC floods the floor of your patio. If you are wanting to order some room service you have to go and get a menu from the front desk. There are none in the rooms. I know that it sounds like I'm complaining a lot but I really did enjoy my stay here and do plan on coming back. I would just be a bad Yelper if I just pointed out the good.

We explained that the calamari was to come with a marinara sauce and she explained that she could get us the side but she would have to WALK across the street to get it and that would take her 10 minutes. \u00a0We COULD NOT believe this. \u00a0First, we paid $60 for the calamari, it was cold and without sides and NOW the waitress tells us she has to walk across the Pacific Coast Highway to get the marinara! OMG! *We ordered margaritas and buckets of corona, twice came without limes, straws and napkins. \u00a0The appetizers (once arrived) came without appetizer plates for our group. \u00a0Had to hunt down the server to ask for these items each time. \u00a0You probably are expecting that they were super busy by the type of service we received but only 2 of the 5 bungalows were rented out on a sunny Saturday. \u00a0Looks like their reputation has already traveled by word of mouth because this place SHOULD have been packed...It was SLOW!*Because the bungalow next to us was empty, and closest to the bar we had groups of people wandering in and sitting at the open bungalow next to us. \u00a0They even ordered drinks and the server seemed okay with this. \u00a0We told the server that we thought this space was to be rented and not just open to the public, I mean, we did PAY $1400 for this bungalow for the DAY so we expected it to be private and it wasn't. \u00a0The server rolled her eyes and told the group of people that were sitting in the open bungalow that WE had a problem with them being there... She made us look like the bad guys so the group had a few choice words to say to our group before exiting. \u00a0Really professional! \u00a0* The parents of our group asked to speak to a manager before we left to tell them of our experience. \u00a0We got the restaurant/bar manager who told us the bungalows were completely separate from the Hotel/Bar and that there was nothing he could do since the bungalow manager went home for the day. \u00a0He pointed out that he took off the COLD calamari from the bill (WOW, THANKS FOR THAT!) and we explained that it was not about the money it was about letting him know of the service. \u00a0He was very uninterested in our feedback. \u00a0We explained to him how a member of our group was going to reserve this space for his wedding rehearsal dinner and now after this he wouldn't. \u00a0The manager (can't remember his name, maybe John? \u00a0Shorter guy, brown hair, thin) said, \"Well if the service SUCKED as bad as you say then don't come back!\". \u00a0Unbelievable. If you still want to go through renting one of these bungalows after this review, just know you have been warned... it is not worth the money and you would be better off bringing your own food and having a party on the public beach ten feet below this space.", "date": "9/15/2013"}, {"review_id": "aaAmpGV2Zrgzr2ebyEcH7w", "user_id": "--lXWAXvP10m_4qyXVFokA", "user_name": "C C.", "business_id": "pPJLCarPr3kmvnV0OvmZYQ", "stars": 4, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "I was looking for a hotel in the Laguna Beach area for a relaxing night to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday.

We picked this hotel for the location and for their pet-friendly policy (it wouldn't be a family vacation without our pup!)We were in one of the two bedroom apartments in the Bahia wing. We booked our rooms on Priceline because booking a 2 bedroom apartment was not an option on the hotel's own website. I was looking for something more than your typical hotel room because frankly, we have a lot of stuff for the baby, and because I wanted the convenience of a mini kitchen for prepping baby food (I hate using hotel bathroom sinks for this kind of stuff). BONUS!! When we stepped into our room, we discovered the room was equipped with a FULL- sized kitchen (full-size gas range, dishwasher, microwave, big kitchen sink, etc.) I mean, one could prepare Thanksgiving dinner here! Huge plus for us (we even thought about making dinners here but that never happened ...). I also wanted the 2 bedroom because there was a balcony (more on that later) and a a separate sitting area/living room. Unless you are in one if the ocean front rooms, I don't think balconies are available otherwise (but I could be wrong). Having a balcony was important to us so we could sit outside and enjoy the natural air, drink a glass of wine and relax without fear of waking the baby once he went to sleep. The room was literally an apartment - for our purposes, perfect! Oh, one thing before I forget, I actually had to make 2 bookings for 2 different rooms (a single, and a 2 bedroom apartment) because the 2 bedroom apartment wasn't available for all the nights we needed at the time of booking. At check in, the front desk staff, upon realizing we had 2 different booking for 2 rooms, \"upgraded\" us for no charge and let us check straight in to the 2 bedroom apartment - I thought that was awesome because I was dreading changing rooms after 1 night (just imagine ... a pack and play, stroller, the toys and, getting our pup accustomed to another room).The balcony for the room literally overlooked the valet stand - not a huge deal as we had reasonable expectations for the type of room we booked. The issue with this setup though is that there is a smoker section next to the valet station which was outside of our room and the when people smoked there, the smell drifted on to our balcony, and into our room. I have a baby - this was not cool. Also, depending on the way the wind was blowing, smells from the restaurant could waft in (not as bothersome as the smoker station). I thought about asking for a different room, but (see above), moving into another room would have been a pain in the ass, so I just closed the patio door when the smells became unbearable. We weren't in our room all that much, so I only had to do this a few times luckily. The staff was very friendly, the housekeeping service was also friendly and thorough. I tried to \"schedule\" housekeeping service around my child's nap time, which worked some days and not others. The room (Room 2) was furnished with old-school beach type furniture - nothing fancy, but I thought it fit the atmosphere. My only problems with the room were (1) there was some weird staining on the bathroom walls - I hoped it was just water marks, but the bathroom walls could use a fresh coat of paint or a scrub down; and (2) carpet that was not tacked down as my child quickly discovered. Other than that, the room was nice, clean and comfortable. \u00a0The beach in front of the hotel was awesome, and clean. They have super friendly beach attendants that will set up lounge chairs and umbrellas for you. Breakfast at the Beach House was decent - great morning views of the beach and ocean, and while the food was nothing to write home about, it was decent. We had room service dinner on our first evening there from the Mare (?) restaurant. Awful. Seriously, not good food - I wouldn't want to eat that again at any price (and we paid $70 for 2 dishes!). I am trying to get an $8 charge removed for \"water\" that was not offered in our room, and that we did not consume. No response yet, but I am confident that will work out. I know it's only $8 but being charged for something that wasn't used just bothers me. We enjoyed our stay here overall. For the price, Pacific Edge was decent and we would stay here again but would hope for a room free of odd wall staining and away from smokers.", "date": "8/30/2013"}, {"review_id": "7vPngXp-v2-dKWO4OLk8cQ", "user_id": "r6eZdjK09if7CYTs_m6ZJw", "user_name": "Robert.

At night we hung out on the balcony and spotted quite a few lobster boats getting their midnight catch. The room definitely has an updated retro vibe. It's fairly priced and the perfect location to hit up all the shops, eateries and the beach.

Highly overated, sub-standard, sometimes dirty, and a grossly overpriced motel that is still simply fabulous.THE PRO'S: Location! Location! Location! No attitude or pretencious Orange County lifestyle. \u00a0A staff to die for! They excel in customer service (hello Stacie...can you come home with us?) Restaurants and shopping abound and many within walking distance. \u00a0The sound of the surf everyday \u00a0is so wonderful. Very FAMILY in a great way. We came with zero kids but so welcomed their sounds every morning beachside.THE CONS: 'FORCED' valet parking at $22.40 ($20 plus tax) a day plus tips in/out. Insane! Annoying! Slow! No options to self-park; even with a fee. The very worst feature of this property was FORCED valet... Dirty, older rooms. Minimal effort to update, let alone clean them. Not even a low-end $59 cheap microwave is included for my $332 a night motel room tarriff. Bring your own bar soap and your own Kleenex (our maid never supplied either all 4 days of our stay).Okay, I've picked on this wonderful Laguna Beach property because I can. I came here decades ago (this property is now 40-plus years in age) and at that time it was called VACATION VILLAGE (now a facade name replaces that calling itself PAFICIC EDGE HOTEL). It's still VACATION VILLAGE; just they've designed a way to charge you now for parking, charge you for kitchen supplies ($20), offer you Wi-Fi speeds for $10 (it's free if you like dial-up speeds). It's become a nickel & dime property. Again, I return to their sub-standard and forced lousy valet parking at $22.40 a day plus $5-10 for tips.Our check-in found us with no working elevator, no working remote for the TV, no microwave for our $332 a night room with kitchenette, no room available/ready at check in at 4:30PM. \u00a0Our balcony had torn carpeting that was a bit dangerous and when I sat down in the balcony chairs, it broke placing me onto the floor (yes, I'm fit).It's classy BEACH from an era without Marriott/Westin style and for that reason and that reason alone (plus staff), I suggest this motel on the beach. I still love it!It's a 5-star experience for this tacky dive motel that is at best a 2-3 star motel. \u00a0Your personal experience will greatly vary based on whether you have a oceanfront room or not.Advice: \u00a0Also read reviews and see photos on TRIPADVISORS.COM.", "date": "7/16/2010"}, {"review_id": "HRD-gcJJL6zuJeBBJ_zGgw", "user_id": "VT835r2i54jJQ-tOBgPyOw", "user_name": "Branden L.", "business_id": "pPJLCarPr3kmvnV0OvmZYQ", "stars": 2, "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "text": "Great access to the beach.

The location is excellent, close to nearby shops and the beach but unless you fork out for a renovated Beach Front Villa, or Bungalow I don't think the hotel will match up with its fabulous location. I had a Village room and even if that were set on the beach the views couldn't make up for how dumpy and depressing my room was. I was in Room 55 of the Surf Tower. It was small and tucked away on the side of the building facing the stairway of the next building. When I walked in the room reeked of pot despite being a smoke free room. It was small, plain, no color, gray, and just felt overall old and run down. The furniture looked newer but you can put nice furniture in a dumpy room and it's not going to make it any better. The place could use some sprucing up, inside and out. I was surprised when I pulled up because the photos make the place look so nice and renovated on the outside. Truth is the building looks old and dirty. Time was taken around the lobby entrance but as you fan out to the rest of the hotel it looks like a step above a dive. I could've accepted that if my room was nice, clean, and thoroughly renovated. Seems as if they just threw a few pieces in just to make it new but they didn't complete the job. Then they push it off as a boutique hotel. The carpets were hideous and felt weird on my feet. I ended up wearing flip flops the whole time. Head board was loose. The bathroom needed updating. Could use some color. The sink looked nice but the shower/tub wasn't the nicest thing to look at. The grout was dirty and chipping in spots. The shower went from hot to cold to hot and back to cold in seconds. I got hypothermia and 2nd degree burns in minutes. Walls were paper thin. The air conditioning worked well and the TV was okay but the lack of entertainment options wasn't appealing. WiFi sucked and could barely be reached in my dungeon of a room. I don't know how the other rooms fared but you can't beat the location of this place. You just have to be willing to deal with some of their issues. On the positive side the staff was friendly and helpful. The valet staff was also friendly but I did have an issue with the $24 valet fee to just park it around the corner. I think this hotel is taking advantage of its fine location with their rates but they don't deliver on the overall experience. I would probably try it again if I had the money to do a Beach Front Villa or something upgraded. I'm sure more care were put into those rooms but based on what I've read overall, I'm not too sure now. My room served it's purpose but it was not the relaxing time I expected.

They accommodated my every need quickly and pleasantly, but the bad news is that I had to contact them 4 different times for things that were wrong. It all comes down to details and unfortunately, this hotel was sloppy at bestFirst, when I checked into my room, it was overlooking the parking lot. Ok, no biggie, not going to ruin my vacation. The rooms are outside rooms and I was staying by myself, so I didn't feel all that secure. Then I noticed there was no security lock inside the room for me to latch the door with. Icky. But still ok, not going to ruin my vacation. Then, I went to order room service - No menu in my book. Ok, no big deal, I'll call and have one delivered. 30 minutes later (and starving) no menu delivered. So I walked up to the front desk and they immediately gave me one stapled together and photocopied. When I called to order, apparently this menu was out of date and some things (that I wanted) they didn't have anymore. Ok, I can be flexible. Then I wanted a nice glass of wine - nope - can't order any alcohol. BUMMER. Food was excellent I have to say. The restaurant onsite is the Beachhouse. Food was great and they delivered it in about 20 minutes! Ok, time to go to sleep - wait, no bedside lamps for me to read my book by. Just overhead flourescents. Hmmmm. I then go to slide the clock on the bedside table over closer to me and discover it's odd and far away placement was to cover up a big hole in the top of the nightstand. Now I'm starting to feel like I'm staying at a Motor Lodge.Then tried to order a movie and the the TV wouldn't turn on. So I called the front desk and the maintenance guy said that with the A/C on in the room, the back of the TV's froze up. Hmmmm. I wasn't using the A/C, but ok. Whatever. He got it working.My room was also butted up against another room with a connecting door. I could hear my neighbors clearing their throats. So, I slept with ear plugs which made me a little nervous considering there was no security lock on the inside of my door as mentioned before. Bed was comfy. Got up the next morning and after breakfast wanted to indulge and take a nap before heading to the beach. Cue the bandsaw directly across the street. A construction crew was working on the property directly in front of my room. Here is where the staff come into play: they switched my room to a new one immediately and it was a HUGE suite. It was the only one they had left and gave it to me for the same price. Nice. But upon checking in to that room here is what I noticed:A huge hole above the TV in the bedroom where the cable was being spliced in from upstairs TV the molding was peeling off of the baseboards in the bathroom, the mini blinds in the bedroom and bathroom were all bent and hanging crooked, a lightbulb in the bathroom was burnt out, the reception on the TV in the bedroom was all fuzzy and the movie I was watching suddenly cut out and I couldn't get it back. I had to call maintenance and they came and fixed it. That made the reception get better too, there was a HUGE full kitchen in this place and not one single pot, pan, plate or utensil to cook with. You had to request everything you thought you might need.

I decided to stay in Laguna Beach for a weekend and saw the group had a hotel in Laguna so I assumed it was a sure thing it would be great. I was wrong!! The good thing about this hotel is it is right on the water, has a great restaurant with really delicious food and an outside deck that you can sit at night and enjoy a nice glass of wine or have dinner while hearing and watching the waves. The bad part however is even though they try to have the same modern boutiquey feel as their other hotels, this facility is old and small and ends up looking and feeling more like a motel 6. Their was a part of the carpet that was ripped and bathroom looked old and their was some rust in the corners, it just really looked like it needed a good remodel. I know most hotel rooms in Laguna are small but even with it being small I just expected a lot more from a Joie de Vivre hotel than this.

I had to fix the cheap bedding with the lumpy mattress pad and to my horror saw that this mattress had been pissed on and who knows what else. The room has been painted a bold, bright yellow green, which for some reason doesn't photograph accurately on their website and appears inoffensive. However these paint colors are the opposite of restful and do not give off the surf 60's cool that is supposed to be happening here. \u00a0No one has come to our room as requested to drop off a blanket, replenish towels, or anything. \u00a0Cheap furniture, weird and ugly ineffective blackout drapes, uncomfortable deck chairs, offensive paint on the walls - okay I can tolerate it for a night or two but after seeing the mattress I had to tell all of you to avoid this place.
