As someone who has just graduated to V2 problem sets, I know I will be coming back to Bridges to continue leveling up.The professionals are knowledgeable and helpful and the facilities are well-maintained. There's a weight room and treadmills upstairs, and the bathrooms are always clean and well-stocked (not to mention the sauna!!).Cost-wise, Bridges is pretty typical of climbing gyms and offers discounts for college students and commuters across a bridge.

What's pretty cool is that if it's your first time at Bridges, you can go in, free of charge (but I believe you have to have a member take you in), and it doesn't even take up the member's guest pass. Another thing that I found interesting is that once you climb to the top of a wall, you can climb over the wall where they have a platform for you to walk to a \"ladder\" to take you down; this is something I have not seen before at other rock climbing locations. Additionally, there are also some standard gym equipment for you to use, like many other rock climbing gyms I've been to. The gym itself is not huge, but is sizeable enough to not feel crowded with other climbers in the gym.One thing to note is that the shoes for rental are in women's sizes, so if you're a dude, order one size up!Having been at both Ironworks and Bridges now, I think I'm a pretty big fan of Bridges, just because of the sheer amount of wallspace for bouldering.

It may not have all the bells and whistles of a Planet Granite or Touchstone gym, but it makes up for it with a tightly knit but extremely welcoming community (and of course some righteous slacklining).Just to be clear - Bridges is a bouldering gym. They do have some toproping in the back, but this is more for kids' birthday parties than anything.The reason that the routesetting is so awesome here is that they reset at least one wall every Tuesday, so you never run out of new problems! Each wall stays up for about a month so you have ample time to work on any given problem. Plenty of slab, overhangs at varying degrees, and a pretty decent-sized cave considering the size of the gym. They do tend to grade a little easier, but I think they're addressing this issue by allowing climbers to grade a problem themselves during the first week that is up, then putting up the official grade based on consensus. Pretty cool system!This gym is very friendly to beginners. For starters, there's a 3-day pass for ~$30 on Groupon! They also have an introductory class that seems very helpful from what I've overheard during my sessions. Additionally, climbers here are super-helpful if you're struggling with the beta, and not condescending at all. That's what I love about climbing... even though it's an individual sport, there's no sense of competition between climbers; we're all just trying to get up that rock!As far as membership goes, Bridges is the most budget-friendly option. For those of you who commute across a bridge (waddup Vallejo), annual membership is only $360, which is a steal! They also have semester memberships available for students.Their other workout areas are pretty nice. I like that there are always slacklines up. The weightlifting section is much-improved since they added that huge power rack. Plenty of hangboards that you can swap out too! There are several treadmills and rowing machines upstairs for those of you who actually like cardio :PLockers and bathrooms are decent. Sauna room is nice. Towels available at the front desk!Parking is just ok. They have their own lot, but it's small and cramped.

On the side of the rocks is an area for slack lining. My home gym only has one slack line. It was very cool seeing slack lines with different lengths, tightness, and hight. Much easy to get into slack lining here and a bit easier to progress as a beginner. Very cool aspect I would love my gym to take on is the peer rating for the routes.

Open slack lining and free classes every Saturday! Easy enough perk to take advantage of if you want to try it out. Full gym, yoga classes, sauna. This place really has it all. Even if you were just looking for a gym membership with occasional climbing, this would be a great deal. The staff are very friendly and helpful too!

So here's my review!Setting up the massage, I called in to the number listed on their website, and eventually a massage person called back. She had me go online and fill out their waiver form, then call into the main office to help me redeem my Groupon in time (it was expiring soon). She gave me a convenient time slot for the massage, within a half a week.Arriving at the gym for the massage, I came about 10 minutes early, which was good, because they had me fill out another form (besides the waiver) about my health history, sore muscles, etc. Then I was to bring the form to meet my massage practitioner, Justin. I recalled from another Yelp review that it was kind of a bummer to wait in a rock climbing gym, as opposed to in a day spa...but I didn't have to wait at all, was greeted immediately upon entering the \"massage corner,\" even though I was still a tad early.Justin's massage started with a couple of minutes of touch without any oil--I was reminded of the feeling of rubber, and was wondering if a sports-style massage doesn't use oil. But then, with oil, he massage my back, concentrating on my lower back. I won't lie, it was a little painful, but I decided to go with it. Glad I did, because the massage seems to have opened up some kind of new energy for me. I found myself thinking about a professional problem that's been plaguing me for a few weeks, and I came up with a solution. Do \u00a0you think massage brings oxygen to the brain? The rest of the massage felt great--no pain, even around my knees that had been troubling me. I don't know much about what a sports massage would be like--I've mostly gone to day spas out of town while on vacation--but the style of this massage wasn't radically different than the others I've had.The \"massage corner\" was darkly lit, no audible noise from the gym right outside, and In the background played some great piano music (not New Age, thank goodness, more like Jazz/ Classical/ Improv). \u00a0Nice paintings!Used the restroom while I was there, it had a sauna and showers.

There were only a handful of people in the Spinning classes (and I actually was the ONLY person taking a Spinning class one morning). The Spinning classes take place in the small group fitness studio, and they drag a few bikes in for each class (and then take them away after class). The only thing that bothered me about this is the fact that the bikes were sitting on the soft mats, which meant the bikes moved slightly each time my weight shifted side to side during pedaling.The yoga classes take place in a tin shed (literally) next to the main building of the gym, but the interior of the shed is actually quite nice. Clean, smooth hardwood floors, nicely painted walls, good insulation (which was essential since I was there during winter), and nice yoga props. Very cozy.I got to do some rock climbing one day while I was there, and it was a lot of fun. Most of the routes are free climbing, but there is one wall where you can belay with buddy. It had been over 10 years since I had last done any rock climbing, so it was an interesting experience trying to climb again, but it was fun! You can rent shoes if needed, and also chalk if you like.There is a weight room with weight machines (if that's your kind of thing), and also a few treadmills upstairs for some cardio.Very nice and very helpful staff. Instructors for the Spinning and yoga classes are great.When I go back to CA to visit, I'm pretty sure I will come back here for my yoga, Spinning, and even try some more climbing, and maybe try some of the other group fitness classes they offer (tai chi, group strength, etc.).", "date": "3/5/2013"}, {"review_id": "LgMI9C3G8YhMVg--hpwpFQ", "user_id": "0m-7A68bctvAHXPhMEazTg", "user_name": "Lorissa W.", "business_id": "p6L53V8l3R2PmESjULYyzA", "stars": 4, "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Michael Hoffman is a great massage therapist. \u00a0Too bad the rock climbing center smells like feet and over run by children during their day camp rock climbing activities. \u00a0It's not relaxing being surrounded by lots of little kids. \u00a0Their waiting area is shabby and not exactly comfortable. \u00a0This is a great place for rock climbing but not a great spa experience for a massage. \u00a0Again, that is not the fault of the massage therapist. \u00a0He's wonderful.", "date": "6/19/2014"}, {"review_id": "MzJRucPax4JhlL7fa8nMgA", "user_id": "utaJvh52C_-WjflPpCUFLg", "user_name": "John M.", "business_id": "p6L53V8l3R2PmESjULYyzA", "stars": 4, "useful": 2, "funny": 1, "cool": 1, "text": "To start off my return to the Review World!I'll review one of my favorite to-go pastimes when I'm looking to level up physically and spiritually Rock ClimbingThough this doesn't beat rock climbing on actual mountains, it is a good alternative if you are a college student in the bay area.

It has always been something I've been interested in, but I just never had the chance. A few months ago, I had a blast in my brief introduction to outdoor climbing (see review of Cragmont Park yelp.com/biz/cragmont-pa\u2026), but from what I've heard, the indoor experience is quite different.So, with yet another SFGate deal in tow, I met up with a friend after work to check out the beginners class at Bridges. From the get go, I could tell that the atmosphere was friendly and welcoming, and even though both of us were absolute n00bs, no one seemed to think any less of us.When we walked in, we were greeted by Chris (who was also the teacher). He was very friendly, and didn't mind answering any of our asinine rookie questions. The gym itself - although not very large - is very clean, and patrons can immediately notice that the ownership takes great pride in maintaining the facilities.I'm not sure how crowded it can get on weekends or on nights when they have special events, but on this Wednesday evening, around 7 pm, it was relatively quiet, then picked up a bit around 8. It never got to the point of overcrowding with people bumping into each other. There was still plenty of room for everyone to enjoy the walls.As mentioned earlier, since I am a rookie to indoor rock climbing, I really no have a basis for comparison with other facilities, but one thing that confused me here is the labeling of the routes. They use a system that starts with B for beginner, continuing upward through a series of numbers to indicate difficulty, all preceded by the letter V. So, VB would be the absolutely easiest, followed by V1, V2, and up.However, sometimes it seemed that the ones deemed the lowest in difficulty were not such a cinch after all, and others with V4 and above were a snap. Perhaps I was doing it wrong, but I'll probably figure it out as I return to use up the remainder of my SFGate passes.As for the comparison to outdoor climbing, other than the obvious disparity in equipment involved, I must say that they aren't so different after all. They both ultimately require the same level of concentration, the same muscle groups, and similar technique. I'm not well versed enough in the \"culture\" of rock climbing to know if there is any rivalry between the two groups (I assume there is), but I enjoy both equally as well.The barrier of entry for indoor climbing is much less imposing, as no equipment is needed, much less instruction is required, and above all, it is much more affordable and accessible. You can pretty much take off and visit the indoor gym whenever it strikes your fancy - much like you would the normal fitness center - but the same certainly cannot be said for outdoor climbing.If you don't feel like climbing walls on certain days, there are also treadmills, slacklines, a dry sauna, and even a soon to be weight room currently in the works! With the all day pass, feel free to come in and out throughout the course of the day.Best of all, Bridges is located conveniently adjacent to Pacific East Mall, which should more than satisfy all of you Asian food aficionados out there.

The staff here are friendly and extremely helpful. It also wasn't that packed when I came in but im guessing that it was because it was a weekday. They offer different levels of difficulty for rock climbing, and I am nowhere near what you would call 'experienced' \u00a0lol.. only because because I mainly do it for just the fun and thrill..but the staff here are completely understanding and supportive. I can't believe people actually climb without a harness though...I, for one, am not that ballsy..haha. But I totally understand that when you get really good at something, you really want to push yourself to the limit. Anyways this place is great, definitely check it out especially if it's close to home. I had a blast here, and I'd surely be back with friends next time and do zip lining since that's next on my bucket list. They also have groupon deals that go on sometimes so keep a look out for those cause they offer really good prices! Now check this place out and go burn some calories!!!", "date": "9/24/2013"}, {"review_id": "tXI7eHbZh7hWQja68MMSkQ", "user_id": "F74HPkBI8B96o9B-FXBDBQ", "user_name": "Martin P.", "business_id": "p6L53V8l3R2PmESjULYyzA", "stars": 4, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Got the all day deal for bouldering.

I guess this place is bouldering, which is different from rock climbing. you're not strapped into a harness or anything, you just climb a wall and if you fall there's a bunch of mats to catch you. the first time is HARD, especially if you're like me and have no upper body strength. your body uses all these muscles it has never worked before, and I only made it over the wall once. The second time, however, I made it several times and moved on to a higher wall. I like that there are different walls and routes set up so the place works for beginners and experts alike.

Bridges is a smaller rock gym than my normal one (Hangar 18 in LA), but it has plenty of challenging routes to try. i came before 3pm, so the day pass of $10 was really reasonable. The place definitely caters to those who prefer bouldering, as there are only six roped climbs, at least two of which are for kids. Speaking of kids, both my nieces, age 10 and 3, really enjoyed themselves...but not because of the climbing. They really enjoyed playing on the slacklines, and I must admit, I thought they were pretty cool too. But I wanted a workout so I stuck to the walls. Both of the main bouldering walls are higher than I'm used to, but the really thick padding on the ground is more than I'm used to also, so it's relatively safe if you fall. There were plenty of climbs to keep me interested, and there just happened to be a few experienced climbers at the gym at the same time and there didn't seem to be any shortage of climbs for them, either. There's also a pretty big cave section for those who like a good challenge. My wife isn't big into climbing, but did enjoy the yoga classes they have there, and any time I can take her with me to one of my activities, the better. So the combination of rock climbing, slack lining (think tight rope walking), yoga/pilates classes, traditional gym equipment (weights, treadmills, bikes, etc.) and an affordable day pass (regular memberships are ~ $45/month) gives Bridges a four-star rating from me. \u00a0I'd give it five stars if it were bigger and offered more rope climbs.", "date": "11/30/2011"}, {"review_id": "9dh0aYDW0q_GHKDd6fLcUw", "user_id": "AGToFpJwPad7C_tz2iI6cQ", "user_name": "Yijia W.", "business_id": "p6L53V8l3R2PmESjULYyzA", "stars": 4, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "I do regular exercise here recently, a bit depressing and the stretching pad smells terrible on the 2nd floor.

She bought the Yelp deal last week, so she wanted to use it, I bought another deal just because I brought in 2 others with me. This was my very first time rock climbing. I've only seen the rock climbing portion at City Beach in Fremont. Bridges has more paths than that. They have a large rock in the center of the gym and another that covers about two walls of the gym. With the four of us, we didn't get to try all of the paths (since a lot of them looked too difficult for beginners), but we spent a good 3 hours there. Their paths were color coded, so if you had no idea what you were doing, you can follow those colored tapes and somehow find yourself at the top. I wish that works as I was climbing. I was scared of heights and could not see anything when I just held myself up close to the wall. Luckily their floors are covered with this thick, fluffy cushioned mat, otherwise, I wouldn't dare to jump. They also have paths with a harness. I actually managed to go to the very top with those. For some reason, those rocks are not so easy to grab alone. For the experienced climbers, they do have a commentary book on the side where you can request for certain paths to be made.Bridges Rock Gym has two fitness rooms: one upstairs, one near the main entrance. There's a room with ping pong. Also a part of the gym is filled with balancing ropes. I glanced at their schedule of activities, they seem to also have yoga and zumba classes. Their staffs are friendly and helpful. Luckily the gym is not overly crowded like your typical 24 Hour Fitness. If you want machines that don't smell like sweat and possibly in mint condition, do come here to work out.The Yelp passes actually pays for your entire day's activities. It also include using their non-rock climbing facilities. And if you want to use it for rock climbing, shoes and chalk fees are included in the pass.

The boys had a terrific time on the climbing walls and on the slack lines. The fee was very reasonable and, more importantly, the support couldn't have been better or more friendly. \"Alec\" supervised, instructed and belayed our kids and did a really good job of it. He was encouraging to the boys, including one who was a bit frightened and reticent, while, at the same time, maintaining control and keeping them from doing anything endangering to themselves or others. He was wonderfully patient and understanding...and trustworthy. The birthday package we purchased entitled our little group to an hour of supervised climbing and then an hour at their indoor picnic tables to share food. You're allowed to bring in your own. However, we didn't want to do the food thing as we were taking the boys to the Parkway theater for movie and lunch after climbing, so we arranged for our kids to be able to climb on the non-belayed \u00a0climbing walls. We were told that if we wanted supervision for that hour there'd be an extra charge. We decided to supervise ourselves, but Alec came over even though he didn't have to and he stayed with us for the second hour on both the climbing walls and the slack lines, as well. In the meantime, the manager, whose name I didn't get, was all over us seeing to it that everything was going well for our kids. I was struck by how gracious and attentive he was, particularly considering that the place was quite busy and he had a lot more to do than to take care of us.Our sons have climbed at a number of rock gyms. Mission Cliffs in SF is more impressive than Bridges as its climbing walls are probably 2-3X higher than at Bridges and there are far more of them, but, on balance, we'll be going back to Bridges in part because it's really quite nice and in part because the people there made it a very positive experience.

If you look around, you'll find some lines strapped in at knee level, which turn out to be for slacklining - one of the funniest activities i've ever done.Upstairs, they have a loft which has a couch and flat-screen TV to watch DVDs. There's also Anne's Cafe where delicious smoothies are served. Sometimes they even have free samples, baked fresh in their ovens! There are also rowing machines, free weights, treadmills, and Precor machines. Explore some more and you'll discover that they have yoga 7 days a week, in the brown Yoga shed next door. Finally, you'll find some gymnasts rings that have been put up in the corner. Great for doing inverted pull ups / push ups and general ring work...

One sister was really a natural, she was up there in no time like a spider monkey. And so was another friend. The beauty of this place is that there are other friendly patrons that gave us the space and time we needed to conquer that first wall as warm up. Then as a team, we opted to step up the challenge a notch and tried the opposing wall which had a room for us all to be up the boulder, so to speak, and enjoy the would be view (if there were any, say, sky and mountain ridges whathaveyou: but in there it was fluorescent lights and the ceilings, which was a okay) Still, Joe was checking up on us and was encouraging. We had so many questions about the markings on the walls and the difficulty level of each color in the indoor rock wall. We had time goofing off on our attempts to conquer the beginner pegs to the intermediate ones. We got so carried away, we were helping my sister \u00a0map out expert tracks 18 feet up on the hardest wall with the steep angle...she made it...or so we thought, her arms gave her away on her last reach up top. Needless to say my spider monkey sister freefell from 18 feet up and landed thankfully, on both feet! Thank goodness, with no injury. You don't get a harness when you do most walls; that's why its more bouldering, really than it is rock climbing. \u00a0But there is one section where you could try climbing with the harness and belaying; but very limited spots and it wasn't quite inviting as the bouldering walls.We tried the slacklines as well and that was loads and loads of fun and laughter as we each tried to shake less and cross the lines with little help from ropes and we struggled with cool, calm and collected steps to cross the lines.If you've tried bikram yoga before you'd be used to the sweaty smell of the shoes...but other than that, it was awesome.", "date": "10/20/2011"}, {"review_id": "oCnAZRX0XneDZ10YLnuQ3g", "user_id": "hfKrvgheyM2K6ZzJeFjvEQ", "user_name": "Allen Y.", "business_id": "p6L53V8l3R2PmESjULYyzA", "stars": 5, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "text": "Things I like about this place:It's not that crowdedThey specialize in bouldering and it's awesome The slackliningThe gym at the top of the stairsCan buy half off coupon in bulk onlineLocationNot sure if I like these things so much:The topping outNo top ropingBit pricey", "date": "3/27/2010"}, {"review_id": "4wAgTCImcI7Ozx0iW_dcdA", "user_id": "rmnAz9F3yc5OL-66IbwTmw", "user_name": "Joshua S.", "business_id": "p6L53V8l3R2PmESjULYyzA", "stars": 5, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Friendly workers and a great variety of routes.", "date": "8/15/2012"}, {"review_id": "8l3LMjMXT1Q1x0GVAIi2-A", "user_id": "onx_uHOJeUTPZ2giopGdmg", "user_name": "Jonathan T.", "business_id": "p6L53V8l3R2PmESjULYyzA", "stars": 4, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Great bouldering gym. \u00a0The ratings seem pretty consistent within the gym and there's a wide range of terrain and difficulty to choose from. \u00a0 Even though already have a climbing gym that is closer, I'd visit this gym whenever I need a change of scenery.", "date": "8/10/2012"}, {"review_id": "ib8xTNPaNSg0TkE-72leaw", "user_id": "iMZKemFeBsI7uFKKKEhJDQ", "user_name": "David N.", "business_id": "p6L53V8l3R2PmESjULYyzA", "stars": 5, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Been coming for a little over a year.

I was one of the earliest members of the gym when it opened, and I was very excited at first. But after *years* of being told the heat situation would be resolved, I have become very frustrated. It's to the point that the instructors ask the class participants to ask the gym owners for heat. I still go to the gym, because it is convenient for me, the rates are very reasonable, and like the facility in general.

I can't really compare bouldering to rock climbing because I've never done rock climbing before . It's really cool how you can exit from the top for the bouldering paths . Just be careful of your head and be sure to duck down a bit when you get to the top because the ceilings are kinda low . If you don't duck down , you will hit your head on the ceiling . The exit route is narrow so be careful and don't get in people's way . There is a mini path on the sides where you can climb down from and exit . In addition to rock climbing and bouldering , they also have slacklining which is basically walking across tight nylon ropes tied against something . It's actually pretty hard to walk across the tight nylon ropes while maintaining your balance and not shaking . It's cool how they have ropes hanging from the ceiling for you to hold onto and guide you across the nylon ropes . They have three kinds of nylon ropes . There's one that's thinner and one that's thicker . There's also one that's very high . It was kinda cool watching one of the staff members jumping and doing tricks on the high slackline . There's workout machines at this gym as well . There's weight machines near the entrance and cardio machines and free weights upstairs . There's also sofas , chairs , tables , and board games upstairs . There's a massage place but I haven't checked it out yet . I heard there is a locker room and sauna too but I haven't checked it out as well . The front of the gym is kind of weird ... it looks like this gym was previously a garage or warehouse that's been converted into a gym . The parking lot is very small and only has a few parking spaces . This gym offers classes like yoga and other stuff which is pretty cool . I will be back for bouldering and to check out some of their classes . This gym is located behind Ranch 99 .

I discover all these places I wouldn't otherwise notice or know about .

If you plan on visiting , check out the deal on Yelp ... it's pretty good . You get 3 day passes to the gym for $25 and if you decide to get a membership at the gym , you can get your activation fee waived . Btw , their shoes might feel very small and cramped .

The bouldering is really cool - we aren't outside climbers (or real climbers, one might say) so we can't really evaluate the awesomeness. When I scramble up and over a V0, when I've conquered that mental game of courage and shaking forearms, it pure euphoria. That's all icing for me though. Really I go there for a monthly rate on decent yoga. The only thing is, the yoga isn't merely decent anymore. The instructors love working with good classes and although they started off really good, they've only gotten better. They bring their interesting personalities and incorporate bits of their own practices, which is what all the best instructors anywhere do. On the flip side though, every single class is beginner appropriate, and they'll help you ease into yoga. Yoga's dangerous for newbies! You can psyche yourself into thinking that you should be able to do that crazy feet-in-the-air crow pose with back arched without crashing into the ground. You can over exert yourself into weeping into the couch for two weeks. The teachers at Bridges are smart and caring, and can quickly find and help the beginners to learn how to self modify and care for themselves. Bridges is awesome. The wee workout center upstairs seems small, but it's never been overcrowded. If you know how to lift weights, then it has everything you need except for good options for doing pull ups.

They don't have any weight lifting equipment, but they do have some treadmills and elipticals. \u00a0The *only* negative about the place is that it would be tougher to climb there alone. \u00a0An 18' fall without a spotter is kind of dangerous, even with the ample padding. \u00a0Climbers tend to be pretty supportive of each other, so I doubt that will be much of an issue once attendance ramps up a bit.All of the staff members I've talked to were super cool. \u00a0If bouldering is your thing and you're already a Touchstone member, I'd be surprised if you don't find yourself with another climbing gym membership. \u00a0I wish I could give this place six stars.", "date": "3/3/2009"}, {"review_id": "3ScbDLrihn5oIfNZ_JXjtQ", "user_id": "65mWqMNvjUSjgrcasOdPMw", "user_name": "Shoshana B.", "business_id": "p6L53V8l3R2PmESjULYyzA", "stars": 5, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Great place to take kids! \u00a0This is one of my daughter's favorite places to go. \u00a0She's 9. \u00a0The staff was super helpful getting her set-up and giving her a few pointers, as well as giving me tips in how to best support her. \u00a0There is such a huge range that she was quickly able to find places on the climbing wall where she could feel successful. \u00a0When she gets tired of climbing, she heads to the tightrope. \u00a0We also LOVE the cafe upstairs. \u00a0Super delicious, organic, \u00a0homemade-style cooking.", "date": "3/24/2010"}, {"review_id": "0x5U9MXx9iVoxqJ8gopOHQ", "user_id": "Ei2-uftLLP-DZcdjc1Sw7w", "user_name": "Angus M.", "business_id": "p6L53V8l3R2PmESjULYyzA", "stars": 5, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Great value when your coming in before 3pm.

My friend got this bring-a-guest free for once a month and he dragged me along.Upon entering the premises, I was like whoa this place looks pretty cool. I heard that this place had just opened at the beginning of the year, (2009).As I'm a complete newbie in rock-climbing, this place is pretty awesome for me. The place still has that \"newly constructed\" smell so that was a plus for me since I like new stuffs. \u00a0The biggest plus was the locker room. Holy crap, this is way better than most gyms I've been to, especially compared to City Beach in Fremont. \u00a0The locker room is not exactly huge but it is really clean and well maintained. \u00a0There's a separate sauna room, shower stalls, mix of small and large lockers, urinals and toilets. Each has its own area and yet blends all together I think that's a clever area design. The upstairs portion houses the cafe area, which I regretfully did not try, but I managed to use the treadmills right beside that area. My friend and I just used it to warm ourselves up before doing any sort of climbing. It was kind of chilly when we got inside at first but was gone just a few minutes of threadmill jog.As for the boulders, I believe are all 20 feet high or so so there are no required harness to climb the walls. However, once ya get to the top, it's still quite scary (for me) and there still risk of attaining injury if you fall down from the top. I fell down once when I missed a handhold and I landed completely on my feet straight down on the mats. My knees did not like that at all. Since I'm not familiar on the climbing grading, I rather not critic that area.During my stay there, a group of kids came in together with a couple of the staffs. Man, some of the kids are being bratty but I applaud the staffs' well-meanings in teaching the kids, and their patience. At the end of our stay, I came out feeling sore on the hands but beaming from the fun. The girl, forgive me I forgot her name, behind the counter was really helpful, answering my friend's questions. Price-wise, I can only stipulate that it's competitively-priced from the other gyms. \u00a0But one of the pluses that they offered is a 10-visit punch card. No expiration and you can come whenever.Overall, a very satisfying experience. If only they weren't so far from my house, I would go 3 times a week.", "date": "5/25/2009"}, {"review_id": "ZKA5NGqdkTtM7qLpbakPaA", "user_id": "hlWm6AYmTjLpxtTbU3sADw", "user_name": "Jonathan G.", "business_id": "p6L53V8l3R2PmESjULYyzA", "stars": 3, "useful": 2, "funny": 1, "cool": 1, "text": "Updated 4: 11/2014: Happy to report that they are finally paying more attention to many of the issues noted below, though I often have to be the one to let them know it needs to be fixed. \u00a0The folks who work here are very nice, and I'm very glad that I can improve my rating in accordance with the improved service. That said, the gym is quite crowded now - congrats on rising membership, but maybe time to find \u00a0a less crowded facility...Updated 3 (7/2013): After nearly three years here, my conclusion is that this is a climbing gym with a lot of potential that is not particularly well managed. \u00a0The staff, while generally nice (though one new staff member has much to learn about customer service) is not very motivated to respond to customer complaints (again, with a couple of exceptions). \u00a0For example:1. The soap dispensers in the showers are still almost always empty. \u00a0I can mention it days if not weeks in a row and NOTHING changes. \u00a0If you come here and need to leave clean (e.g., if you are going to work or a meeting after you work out), bring your own soap. \u00a02. The Pilates balls are almost always under inflated. \u00a0After mentioning it for about a month, maybe they will get inflated. Sometimes it takes 2-3 months.3. The fan near the elliptical machines is invariably so caked with dust it might as well be called a \"dust mite dispenser\" -- it is truly gross. \u00a0When somebody accidentally knocks it over, it emits a dust cloud that spreads for a good 20 feet in all directions. \u00a0I always make sure to turn it AWAY from me when I am working out.4. The sauna is broken in some way about half the time, which would not be the case if they posted the sign with the language that I recommended 2 years ago to tell members not to douse the coals with water, which fries the coils.5. \u00a0They also need some kind of protocol for what kind of behavior is acceptable versus nauseating in the sauna. For example, there is the guy who stands there naked with sweat dripping from his, um you know, creating a big disgusting puddle of genital sweat on the wooden bench. \u00a0There are others who leave the sauna soaked with sweat and water and the coils shorted out, so you have to reset the unit. \u00a0Some seriously strange behavior...6. \u00a0The toilet stalls are frequently out of toilet paper7. \u00a0I tried their massage program, but after two cancellations in a row (one of which I wasn't told about until I arrived), I moved on. 7/13/2013: my wife's massage was just cancelled last minute b/c therapist was \"sick\" (right...we are guessing \"hung over\" is more accurate). Unbelievable - again?! Really?!In conclusion, the ownership needs to hire somebody as a manager who holds staff accountable for taking care of the facilities and maintaining the equipment. \u00a0If they did, Bridges could quickly rise to 4 or even 5 stars. But given some recent bad experiences, it is back down to 2.Update 2: the owner has finally fixed the squeaking elliptical machine and the soap dispensers in the shower have not been empty at all this week (for the first time in ages). \u00a0As I noted, he's a very nice guy and as promised, I've updated my rating again to reflect the improvements. \u00a0Thanks!Update: just a day after posting the below review, the gym finally added more pilates balls (including a large one) and finally inflated the third one. \u00a0For that, I'll add another star. \u00a0Original review This gym has a ton of potential -- if you're a rock climber it gets a better rating.If you want a place to use exercise equipment like I do, it gets only two stars because they don't take care of their equipment and the staff is non-responsive to requests to take care of problems with it. \u00a0There doesn't seem to be a sense of \"I'm taking care of this gym so our customers are happy\" type responsibility among the staff.For example:- their showers are almost always out of soap. \u00a0Very annoying after a workout. \u00a0I've told them probably 20 times, and still almost every time I use the showers, the soap is empty in at least 2 of their 3 shower stalls. \u00a0The attendant on duty could perhaps check the soap every hour or two so this doesn't happen. \u00a0Instead when I look down from the elliptical machine, the attendant is typically surfing the web. - they have not inflated their pilates ball since I joined in September, and I've requested it no less than five times. Come on.- the owner (a very nice guy) told me he was going to get some larger pilates balls. \u00a0I told him that I had a doctor's order to use a larger one as part of my rehab exercises, and he said he'd get one. \u00a0That was three months ago. What happened??- the elliptical machine I use squeaks annoyingly I hope they can get it together and start paying more attention to their equipment and customers, as the gym has a ton of potential! \u00a0And the staff are MUCH nicer than many of the staff at Iron Works. \u00a0But right now, it's definitely not a place I'm excitedly telling my local friends about.", "date": "1/29/2011"}, {"review_id": "cIfJaP5AZt6I1kMhqFhxkg", "user_id": "sLQGmt_DfJqXPCggsGu7CQ", "user_name": "Daisy C.", "business_id": "p6L53V8l3R2PmESjULYyzA", "stars": 5, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "This place is awesome! \u00a0I am not a rock climber but I found it to be way more fun to work out there verses a regular gym. \u00a0The slack lines are super fun and there is a nice sauna in the ladies room. \u00a0The staff are friendly and approachable. \u00a0They also have the best prices around for yoga ($10 a class).", "date": "7/17/2009"}, {"review_id": "y2x-QuSoOH-x16LxbqgJDQ", "user_id": "n5WLMNBl3e6kOXPOd42MpQ", "user_name": "Bryce N.", "business_id": "p6L53V8l3R2PmESjULYyzA", "stars": 5, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "This is a basically A Clean Well-Lighted Place For Bouldering. \u00a0The owner/founders are super friendly, and this is a family affair among two sisters and a husband. \u00a0You'll find wall-to-wall heavy padding under rather high bouldering problems. \u00a0A sauna, a few machines, yoga space, and a kiddie care room. \u00a0They do birthday parties well. \u00a0You can walk from El Cerrito Plaza BART. \u00a0Everything to like. \u00a0Note: the place is bouldering and slacklining focused, no mini-El Capitan's here, and very limited top-roping.", "date": "4/2/2009"}, {"review_id": "IBZ_Wg8-knlpuOH_rBaL8w", "user_id": "5ZrQsjSuNy_OXVghbRxVlg", "user_name": "Bebe B.", "business_id": "p6L53V8l3R2PmESjULYyzA", "stars": 2, "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "i don't top rope, i only boulder, so i was really excited when i heard about this place. i went a few times but i couldn't get down with the culture of this gym. maybe it's that the climbers seem a bit on the younger side and so they aren't thinking about the possibility of getting injured or are just generally more oblivious. all the times i've gone here i had to be really extra vigilant about people wandering around directly below me while i'm on the wall, constantly afraid that if i fell i would hurt them and/or myself. i haven't had this concern at the touchstone gyms, where my experience has been that people hang back until it seems like it's their turn to approach the wall or just ask. also, i described that i was having a problem with the gym equipment and the people working at the desk didn't offer to help me figure it out, which i thought was rude.", "date": "10/8/2012"}, {"review_id": "nA1Ing50uz1AMAby0DwO5g", "user_id": "bnbUeeQ8sbq5aiQxZZ_7ng", "user_name": "Ingrid H.", "business_id": "p6L53V8l3R2PmESjULYyzA", "stars": 4, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "text": "I love this place. \u00a0I use it not for rock climbing but as a gym and for yoga classes. \u00a0Want to give a special recommendation for Yoga teachers Vlad (tues and thurs 4:30 to 5:30) \u00a0and Tosha (fri 12 to 1).", "date": "4/20/2011"}, {"review_id": "Zd4r4PnfoVEsdettReDd_g", "user_id": "x1BhloIsRWTbU4FiU1gEcg", "user_name": "Sarah M.", "business_id": "p6L53V8l3R2PmESjULYyzA", "stars": 5, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "So I called Bridges with an issue I had concerning some vouchers that I wanted to redeem.
