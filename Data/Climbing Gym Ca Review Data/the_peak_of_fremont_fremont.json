We have a family membership and go hangout there a couple times a week after school. Super fun way to hangout together and do something we all love.

I actually have a fear of heights but walls and harnesses made me feel super comfortable! It does take a lot of upper body strength and is a GREAT workout! I barely climbed up two easy walls and I started to break a sweat. The first three walls are the easiest and are used to let people get used to the environment and learning how to \"let go\"! The other walls they offer are very challenging! They have this overhanging wall and it is very difficult and takes a lot of body strength. And the alternative walls are the ones that are color coordinated, which tests your strength by using one color to get to the top. And the walls have cute and silly names that show the difficulty next to it. In addition to the walls they also have bouldering and a moon wall. The bouldering walls are smaller and less spacious but are very challenging, and the moon wall is a extreme test which is for anyone who is interested. Overall is a great place to go rock climbing and would recommend to anyone looking for a wholesome time!

I have climbed here at various frequencies. Although the dream is to be able to afford to climb 4 days a week I am at once or twice a month or 4 times a month. That being said this gym is affordable even more so if you invest in your own gear. A climb is $20, they also have an excellent 10 climb pass for $180. This gym is an amazing place everyone is friendly and there is a variety of skill levels. There are no egos here. I repeat: there are no egos here. I can watch people lead climb all day. Most of my technique has been honed through youtube videos and watching people climb but early on I did take a class with Dylan and that was money well spent. I enjoy the auto belays. I have yet to get really into bouldering. They have an awesome moonboard in the back so download theGym is clean and well ventilated. Staff is friendly. Crowds depends on circumstances really. I usually climb 3:30-4:30 and it isn't too busy there have also been times when I arrive at 11 am and it is crowded. Was packed at 8 on a Friday once. I went last week and shared the walls with a work group. And then in the summer one day I arrived to like 30 kids from the YMCA or what have you. So the crowd varies. Update-official member, climbing 3x a week. Still an awesome gym. And for people in the reviews commenting about being annoyed about being told they were belaying incorrectly, they probably were. City Beach was different, get with the program. And yeah no shoes in the bathroom, I don't want fecal matter getting on the holds. My only complaint is I think this gym can do more to educate/enforce etiquette, I have been here before when they are girl gangs hogging the routes or a loud couple being obnoxious in the bouldering area, or kids running around, etc etc. Otherwise they are good.

My salmon was grilled to perfection, with slightly crispy edges and juicy inside. Better than most salmon I've had elsewhere.They have a huge collection of whiskey. Glenlivet 12 was $10! I had no choice but to keep drinking from lunch through bocce ball.Bocce was fun. You can choose indoors on a hard, thin carpeted surface or outdoors. We played indoors and everyone enjoyed their time.Onto rock climbing. The young gentleman that gave us instructions was witty and engaging. He made the experience even more fun. Most of us went assuming we'd skip the rock climbing portion but due to his witty remarks or our drunken bravado, everyone ended up strapping in and giving it a go.There are various routes to choose. The mark each rock with numbers and letters so the higher the number or further down the alphabet, the more difficult it is.We started with the easiest and it was super easy, even for my drunk self. Now onto the harder wall (see my picture). Started out okay but man..your height, ability to grip, and strength comes into play. But if you can't ring the bell up top, no worries.

It turned out she has a dark side and can suddenly become super disrespectful and mean. I've been going to this gym for about 20 years, from the days when it was called City Beach. In the last couple of years I've been visiting it on and off. I was there a couple of days ago with my two daughters, both aged less than 10. The harnesses they provided are really adult sizes, with very long straps. I commented that in the past there used to be smaller harnesses for children. I know for a fact that City Beach had those. This simple comment apparently triggered Priscilla's dark side. It was as if I unknowingly pressed a wrong button. She said there never was such harness. \u00a0She was probably a toddler or smaller when I started climbing at City Beach. Her behavior changed from then onwards.She kept watching us. That made me and my daughters very uncomfortable. She seemed to be looking for a reason to charge.At one point I got a harness to belay my daughters. I guess this gave her the reason she needed. She came, staring at us for sometime, then came up and claimed that I was not belaying properly. Any climber with a reasonable experience knows there are several ways you can use the gri-gri to belay. There is no single best method. I was shocked. I asked why, what's wrong. She claimed that she cannot tell me and that my way was wrong - that was it. I was appalled she became more aggressive and more disrespectful.Then with the satisfaction of a commander wining a hard-fought battle, she stated that they'd revoke my belay certification since I don't it \"properly.\" I was like, fine, I don't care about \"your\" belay certification.I just came here for some fun climbing with my daughters. Just leave me alone - I returned my harness and belay device.Just when I thought it was over, my daughter needed to go the bathroom urgently. While I was taking here to the bathroom, she yelled from behind \"heyy no climbing shoes in the bathroom\"This really made me angry. For 1) you can put a sign by the door so everyone knows 2) since when it's OK yelling to a customer with a small child about something they wouldn't possibly know about? What happened to courtesy and professionalism? Priscilla was beaming with another victory as she had a chance to yell at me.Then a manager came over. I told him about her behavior. He's like \"well, she's following our safety standards\". I mentioned that there's no one single rule in climbing. But he wasn't really listening. He just defended his employee's behavior, showing absolutely no concern for her extremely rude and disrespectful attitude. Basically they make up their own rules to make you uncomfortable and leave if they so decide based on their whims.Anyway I won't be going there anymore. I'm advising my friends likewise.I don't want Priscilla or anyone else there to unleash their fury at me or anyone I know.", "date": "10/29/2018"}, {"review_id": "AFcssWyw75-3QW4vbcowng", "user_id": "ZoELGLRucNH2WaPGpXmaPA", "user_name": "Shannen R.", "business_id": "yTw59B9_fH110QiEVFizyA", "stars": 5, "useful": 6, "funny": 4, "cool": 3, "text": "10 AUTO BELAYS, FREE CLIMBING, GRIP BARS, AND A CRASH CIRCUS LOOKING COURSE? YAY!The Peak is located right along the 680 Freeway and near many restaurants to eat afterwards. This climbing wonderland shares a space with Bocce Ball and a fancy restaurant. Once you open the doors, you're greeted right away with an employee. Someone will help you put on your harness and show you how to clip on and off the belays. That alone only takes 5 minutes. Afterwards, you can hook up and climb on your own. Climbing up was definitely fun. It took a few tries to let go and trust the auto belays. Once I got use to falling, it was easy to get down lol.There's different rock colors on each belay, so if you're thinking \"only 10 auto belays?,\" well think again. \u00a0You'll find yourself there for about 2 hours or until your arms and grip give out. It's that fun. Don't be shy to ring the bell when you get up, because I did!\"And I'm freeeeee, freeeeeee fallin'.\" For the elites and badasses, you're able to free climb and free fall onto cushions.

You can literally go home and come back as many times as you want in that same day!- $2 for chalk! Trust me, you'll need it. It helps a lot.

Eight of them! \u00a0If you: - are an introvert - are shy - want to do your fitness without people bothering you - are done with being social by the time you get to the gym - never have friends around when you want to go climbing/working out - are friendlessthen this is a great climbing gym option. \u00a0Auto belays allow you to climb the top-roping routes by yourself. \u00a0You don't need a buddy, and if you're like me and work super late into the evening or your friends don't live nearby, then auto-belays are your answer. \u00a0It was the number of auto belays at this gym and the variety/difficulty of routes you could climb with them that convinced me to get a membership here after only being here once.Now, there are plenty of other social folks who climb at The Peak or who come in packs of 3 or 4, but I was so happy to find a climbing gym I could go to without hauling a friend with me or feeling like I would have to bother other folks when I want to climb a route and didn't have a belay partner.That said, if you are indeed friendless, you can also come here and this is a great place to make friends. The community here is super friendly.---I climbed for the first time at The Peak of Fremont and have to say that as a beginner climber, The Peak is very un-intimidating, welcoming, and friendly.A friend and I came here for the first time on a weekend afternoon. \u00a0We were greeted at the front desk and signed our liability waivers electronically, paid, and got our rental equipment in short order. \u00a0There was some kind of promo going on this month, so all rentals needed (harness, chalk, and shoes) were included in the drop-in price - $15! That's much cheaper than I've seen at other local climbing gyms.Since it was my first time climbing, the front desk guy gave us a quick run-down of how to use our harness and how to clip into the auto-belays, and explained the numbering system and some safety tips. \u00a0Then he sent us off to explore. \u00a0My subsequent visits the various front desk folks have been equally friendly and have always answered my questions knowledgeably, with a dash of humor thrown in.There was a good number of people there, but we never had to wait for a route to become available, and this seems to be pretty consistent during the evenings when I come as well. \u00a0You could definitely smell that this was a gym, but the ventilation was pretty good and after awhile you just stopped noticing the vague smell of body odor. Lots of people were climbing on the top-roping routes as well as the auto-belays, and a fair number were also at the bouldering section of the gym as well. \u00a0I also saw a number of kids climbing here that first Sunday, so it seems very kid-friendly as well.The padding was appropriately thick and all of the climbing areas were very clearly marked off. \u00a0There's an open area near the back with an obstacle course above (I'm told it's only opened during group events, like for team building or special occasion reservations), a smith machine, and some basic gym stuff though no free weights of any kind.Overall I had a great time. \u00a0I've been several times since that initial first time, and love the experience and environment enough to get a membership. \u00a0The perks are pretty good, as is the price, and even though I've heard this place isn't as big as Planet Granite, the location and pricing is good enough that I don't mind while I'm still wearing my beginner wings. \u00a0The routes seem to be changed out pretty regularly, and even as a beginner I found enough routes to occupy me on each visit without being bored. My only criticism is I do wish that they had a little bit more in the way of free weights, for more options in terms of alternating my workouts. \u00a0They have a lot of space available in the back area (especially since the obstacle course isn't usually open) so there's a good amount of room for everyone. \u00a0However, it's a very minor criticism and I am otherwise very happy with my membership here.

Lifting your body weight is a great exercise. It is inexpensive and it's a good deal getting a pass, equipment, and entry throughout the day.

Overall, its a pretty decent gym. WHAT I LIKE- Community. This is a smaller gym, so people say hi and faces become familiar. Unlike other climbing gyms, the environment felt very welcoming, which is great because climbing is really about community. - Small size. The gym is pretty small, though they pack quite a few routes into the space. The nice side of this is that even when it gets busy, you never have to wait more than a few minutes for a route.- Autobelays. Most bay area gyms lack autobelays, so the fact that Peak offers 9 is noteworthy (4 are strictly beginner routes, the other 5 have 5.7-13 routes). I loved being able to climb at odd hours without having to convince a friend to meet me at bizarre times.- Staff. The staff is chill and friendly. They're welcoming, helpful, and make an effort to meet climbers. They seem to like what they do, which makes the experience that much better.- Moonboard!!!WHAT CAN BE IMPROVED- Amenities. They're pretty limited. No lockers (just open cubbies), so you have to tote your phone and keys around all the time. No showers, so you can't climb if you need to go anywhere decent afterwards. Restrooms are outside the gym and shared with the neighboring restaurant. Workout area is tired and only has 1 of everything, though there is neat obstacle course. - Routesetting. I like that routes turn over every 2 months or so, but I was underwhelmed with the top rope setting. I felt like the routes lacked creativity and I wasn't doing much problem solving, even with the harder routes. Most routes felt relatively similar. Still a good workout, but a large part of the fun of climbing is the creative problem solving.Other notes: - Grading is fairly soft here, but it's consistent- This is a great gym for beginners. Plenty of basic routes to help you get your feet wet- Parking is plentiful- Prices here are notably lower than the competition, though you don't get as many amenities. Overall, a good experience.

This is also the most inexpensive climbing gym in the Bay Area.Additionally, this is the only gym that I've seen in the Bay Area with auto belays, so you can climb taller paths without the need for a partner. The auto belays work perfectly, and assist you down with a staggered motion. The only thing about auto belays is that if you fall, you'll most likely end up going down all the way, because you will not have a partner to catch you in the same position. You will not be able to rest with the support of a partner. I remember when I was frustrated with a toprope problem, a staff was walking by and gave me a quick tip on how to get over the crux of the problem. The people here are what separate this gym from others, as they seem to genuinely care that you are enjoying your experience here. Keep in mind that this gym is on the smaller side, so it doesn't take too long to explore every path. I'd say it's about half the size of Planet Granite Sunnyvale, if that.
