I liked the gym itself and the girl working there the one day I went, just to be clear.Basically, I went in on a free pass from my boyfriend on 7/10. I had such a good time that I wanted to sign up for a month's pass. She explained to me that my pass was good until 8/10, and if I wanted to cancel, I could do so the day before my renewal in person, or 5 days before over the website/email. Hard times hit, I lost my job, and I unfortunately had to cancel. I emailed on 8/1 asking about canceling vs. freezing my account. The manager took 4 DAYS to bother to reply, so I just decided to cancel since it was the best option for me. So on 8/5 (5 days before my month was up), I cancelled by website.Well, turns out I was charged anyways. I called and the guy working told me that I had misunderstood. I bought a month's pass but it would always renew on the first of the month, so i was charged a prorated $26 on 8/1. I get it. I probably misunderstood and that was my fault. But I explained what happened. I explained that I can't afford it and I literally haven't been back since the first day because I can't afford the equipment. I asked if there was anything they could do. He said they could give me a free month. Which is fantastic since I said I CAN'T AFFORD TO GO THERE AT ALL. So basically I paid for 2 months of this gym to get one good climbing experience and two shitty customer service experiences.Thanks a lot Hangar 18.

The only option to get back down is to climb back down, but, lemme tell ya, I was frightened by the height of the wall and having to climb downward.

Compared to pricey gyms like Sender One, Hangar 18's fees are incredibly reasonable, especially with the Groupon (which I bought) and if you sign up for their emails, they always have special deals. And since it's a chain, your membership will get you into any of their other locations as well. But the reason why I didn't continue my membership after my Groupon ended is because of their routes. Their ratings are bit soft. Almost all of their V1s and a couple V2s felt like V0s. V2s felt like V1s, V3-4s felt like V2s, etc. And their routes weren't that technically difficult either. There were a few fun routes, but as someone who sets routes, I believe it is possible to have fun routes at any rating. Yes, it takes longer to set as you have to think through each move and be more deliberate, but it's worth it if the people who climb it can learn and improve from it. And I just didn't feel any major improvement after my two months were over. Another small gripe I have is that the staff and climbers here weren't that friendly. They weren't rude, but they didn't go out of their way to get to know people. Sure, I found one or two other climbers to talk to, but this would be low on my list of friendliest gyms. \u00a0I've been to other ones where the staff try hard to remember your name, ask how your day was, and then offer tips when you get stuck on routes. And it's that kind of customer service that really makes a gym special. The same goes for the other climbers as well. And it was such a shock when my friend took me on his guest pass to another gym close by and every one there was so friendly! I don't know if it's the way this Hangar 18 is set up or the people, but I didn't feel as welcomed. (On a side note, I came to the gym one night and the staff were shooting this bottle cap around. One hit my leg and they just giggled to each other like schoolkids who thought they were going to get in trouble. No apologies from them whatsoever. That did leave a bad taste, but I think that may have been an isolated incident and I'll give them the benefit of the doubt.)However, I do think this is a great starting gym for beginners with its shorter walls, easier entry-level routes, and affordable prices.

Price is the same as everywhere you go (~$20 whole day including rentals). I'm used to only going to one place back in Norcal so the layout of their walls/rocks were new to me. They have only one section where you could go over the top and then climb down. The majority is just tap out (which is one thing I wish they could change). Their levels ranges from V0 to V10 with +'s and -'s which is pretty cool! As a beginner, I was able to complete V0's and V1's. I also wish they could put more mattings because it feels short and I'm always worried that if I slip near the top, I might land on the ground instead.Anyhow, during the hours I went (10 to 11:30am), there were only like 3 other people. It is definitely not crowded. I feel like not many people know about this place, but once people know, I could definitely see it getting busy. This is solely a bouldering gym, so it doesn't have the many extras that other bouldering/rock climbing places have. There's a small weight lifting area when you reach over the top of the wall. They only have 1 stall per gender, so no locker rooms. I'm definitely excited for the next time I come.", "date": "9/24/2014"}, {"review_id": "T8F8IeF7zhagJA58b-oaKA", "user_id": "SYZZ42Zm9cAKKzZ1Kc0QaA", "user_name": "Nicholas C.", "business_id": "b5pBOaPx0CeVzwjC7j3SgA", "stars": 5, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "This is the first climbing gym I've ever belonged to and I'm seriously hooked. \u00a0They switch up the routes regularly so even though it's a little small, you don't get bored.

This isn't my normal gym as its a bit of a drive, but I try to make it out every month or two to keep things interesting. This gym is definitely on the smaller side and is exclusively bouldering. There is a small top out section, but I rarely use it.The walls here are lightly textured and the holds are relatively new. The routes are interesting with a nice mix of vertical and overhung. The routes are geared towards entry and intermediate climbers. The easy routes are almost all ladders and aren't very interesting, even for a beginning climber. But the v1-v3s are plentiful and diverse. V4-v6 is also common and has a nice split between slopey and crimp routes. Like the rest of the hangar 18 gyms, they use colored holds to mark the routes. I hate this policy because I find it confusing, but MV is better than the other gyms at keeping similar colors separate. Overall the gym feels well maintained and mostly new. Its been quiet and mellow most of my visits (weekend afternoons), giving ample time and space on the wall.

Great location: super close to the 5 fwy and also some food for some post-climbing noms.I like that they change different sections of the wall pretty frequently (just about every week!) so that you always have something new to try *somewhere* in the gym if you've already conquered all the routes you wanted to do at your level. I also like that their holds are relatively new/fresh (or at least, they feel like they are compared to some other gyms I've been to). They have a nice flat wall that I find fun to traverse :) But they also have plenty of problems with overhangs too for increased challenges! There is a portion where you can top out and climb over the wall. In that portion they have a set of free weights and kettle bells as well as a pull up bar and two types of finger boards where you can train. The bench up there is kinda shady.
