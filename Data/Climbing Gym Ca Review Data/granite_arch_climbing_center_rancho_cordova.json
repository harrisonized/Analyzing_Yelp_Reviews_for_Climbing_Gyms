The front desk was informative and very helpful, we came around 30 minutes before the class because we wanted to make sure we got our equipment and stuff all set - but that wasn't really necessary, the class started around 2:10pm and we had plenty of time to spare. You will have to fill out waivers if it's your first time there though, so maybe like 10-15 minutes before a class is appropriate. There are free lockers for you to put your things into, but you must ask for a token from the front desk. If you aren't too worried about your stuff you can also put it away in cubbies near the bouldering area on the right side of the gym. The belay class had about seven people total with one instructor and lasted around 15 minutes. The instructor was really patient and explained things thoroughly - we were able to learn how to tie knots and belay pretty quickly - I thought it was going to be a much longer class but it was pretty simple and doable! Afterward he asked for a few volunteers to try to demonstrate what they had learned and my friend and I were able to switch off belaying each other in the demonstration. And then we had free rein of the gym for the next couple hours! We climbed around and had a good time until they closed, all for a pretty reasonable price of $12.50(ish) - including equipment rental!There were two birthday parties happening during our time there so it got a little chaotic with a lot of kids running around in the beginning, but overall it was pretty quiet after the parties had passed. There were a lot of people climbing too, but we had plenty of routes to choose from as beginners, the facility is pretty large and in a quiet area on Folsom Blvd so I wouldn't worry about it being too busy.I think after the Groupon value expires I'll be trying out a punch card or monthly pass.

The bouldering section was pretty large with a lot of different routes to climb. During the first hour, there were only about 4 other people bouldering, so it was relatively quite and easy to concentrate. During the second hour, there must have been a birthday party or something because all of a sudden there were about 20 young kids running around and and under you while you climbed. It became a little chaotic and I was worried I would fall on a kid since I wasn't very good. It would have been nice if the person leading/teaching the group advised the kids to not climb underneath another climb or to not play with someone else's chalk bag. Other than that, which probably is hopefully not a frequent problem, the bouldering was great for someone who was just starting.

I got a harness, some shoes.. but they asked for my keys as collateral. There's cubbies in the back to keep your stuff OR there was also lockers with a key. You just need a token to use them and that was complimentary. I just had to ask for the token at the counter.. but then you had to hold on to that key.Jeremy led the belay class and he's a super doll. He had patience and expressed knowledge well with his helpfulness. In addition to the belay, I learned how to use the auto belay as well for when you don't have a partner to do the belay while you climb and vice versa. They had several auto belays.I can see why it's a good team building exercise to hit up a rock gym. I seriously had some reflecting to do regarding some trust issues. I didn't trust a belay partner or even the auto belay. When I just went for it, it felt really good. Freeing. It's fun and challenging. The other people climbing offered helpful tips and encouragement.. then there were kids doing it and I always feel like they're my reference point. If kids can do it, fuck yeah I can do it. ..and where the cubbies were, they had a bouldering area where you free climb.

Since this was my first time, I had the option of taking a belay class for an extra $7. We decided against it (because we were pretty nooby at rock climbing anyways) and instead received a free quick training on the auto-belays. They had several auto-belays, each with 3-4 courses of varying difficulty. If you can belay, you will find yourself with a much wider selection. But for our purposes, auto-belay courses were enough. They also had a section in the back set aside for bouldering and gym equipments. We tried our hand at some easy bouldering tracks after top-roping for the majority of our time there.For first time climbers out there: The skin on my hands got torn up pretty badly after a few hours of climbing. Granted, I might have had poor technique (according to my slightly more experienced girlfriend), but try not to go too intense on your first try!Everything else wise, we were given free lockers to place our valuables. We didn't realize there was a water fountain (apparently it's by the kids area), so we had to cough up $2 for a large bottle of water. The staff was super friendly (they gave me a total of five bandaids by the end of the day with minimal judgment), and so were many of the people climbing there. (We went there while a summer camp was going on, so many many kids were present as well.) The place is a warehouse, so it wasn't air-conditioned too well, so it may get a little hot even with their big fans going.

It actually wasn't as big as Id imagined since I've been to pipe works and rocknasium in Davis so I was expecting something like that. Regardless it was still a good size and I had a fun time rock climbing.
