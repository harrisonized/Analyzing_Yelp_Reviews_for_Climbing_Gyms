Pros: open climbing area with a lot going on, all different skill levels- Yoga classes - Free-weight/gym area - Dog friendly - Shoes/chalk always available as well as gear discounts \u00a0- Classes for novice climbers/kids- The staff is very friendly, and people are even allowed to bring their dogs. - Staff/management isn't aggressive about selling you on an expensive membership or gear, but they do have deals for people who are regulars.Cons: Can be expensive (?) possibly compared to a conventional gym (chuze is the cheapest conventional gym), but you get what you pay for and what you put into it. If you're only going once a month, just get a day pass.Bottom line: Try it. I might go once a week but I feel more sore doing an hour of climbing than I do from multiple days in a conventional gym each week.Note: due to an accidental miss on a discount by one of the newer associates, one of the managers (Brad Gibeaut) was able to reimburse me the difference and then some, I now have a great pair of climbing shoes and will probably end up spending what I saved on my own bag/chalk etc.", "date": "5/20/2019"}, {"review_id": "UbmPQMdJ-aIRBQWyd51N_A", "user_id": "5WNpVilRzHWPky9uZNsQtw", "user_name": "Coleen J.", "business_id": "YPWvUVKWwKXd0o1xIBArfg", "stars": 4, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "I visited San Diego for the weekend and was in dire need of a climbing gym so we decided to give Grotto a visit!

Because a day pass is $20 and shoe rental is like $6, you only need to go twice before you get your money's worth.Sam helped me out with shoe fit and an introduction. She was very sweet and helpful. She even showed me how to do a pull-up (with band assistance, for now!) in their outdoor weight yard. People are friendly in that they smile at you like you are human, but also leave you alone, which is nice. I still don't know about the different grips, like how to hold onto the pieces that don't have the fingerholds built in. Apparently there are different grips with different names that you can learn about-- someone else told me. That would be helpful info to know as a beginner who was at a loss as to hold onto certain pieces. The only negative is the shoes are super smelly. I don't know whether they spray them but if they are, it's not working that well.

When they have climbing competitions those are sure a hit because they prizes are pretty legit. When you walk in you can take a look at all the walls. There is the overhanging arch, that leads into a cave like area. Straight ahead is some fun technical climbs, and to the left is your overhanging climbs and across from that is your slab problems. Past the slab problems leads a door where there is an outdoor area built for training and getting your strength up. Back inside there is a yoga room, as well as some cardio machines and a small area for stretching. They have a clean facility with bathrooms and showers available to use.

They offer regular outdoor climbing trips and workshops for members which are great for improving as well as testing out your skills.

The bathrooms seem clean and supplies well kept, as with all the rental equipment.The biggest appeal is that for such a cheaper price than Mesa Rim ($25 for day pass with all rental vs. something like $40ish at Mesa), you get a more intimate and friendly place to climb. \u00a0Not to say that Mesa is unfriendly by any means, as I still love that facility, but with the closer knit community that Grotto tries to build it feels like I was getting more bang for my buck somehow.", "date": "2/11/2016"}, {"review_id": "IZV5HxxKm8uD1-RDG8z5SQ", "user_id": "41aO5xpifpJzhUG6fCY1qQ", "user_name": "Gaby J.", "business_id": "YPWvUVKWwKXd0o1xIBArfg", "stars": 4, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 2, "text": "Front desk service can be a hit and miss. I think the guy at the front was more interested in gawking at pretty girls and talking to regulars than making newcomers feel welcomed. When I asked him for a tour, he was a little peeved and asked his friend if he could be excused. Even though I was a customer, I felt I was intruding his privacy and time. I tried to ignore it by thinking he was having an off day but he did it again the next day and the very last day I was there. What the effing hell?! The only time he feigned interest was when his manager was watching. He made me feel very small and insignificant (not cool). On the other hand, the co-owner PF is very nice and helpful as I was a bit concerned about the white supremacy symbol found in many of the grips. Although PF assured me they were just the grip manufacturer's logo, I can't confirm or deny this reasoning as I find no such symbol online. But enough of my concerns, let's talk more about the facilities. The yoga instructors are amazing. I especially like Mara's Acro Yoga class on Wednesdays. The room itself is absolutely delightful with surround sound speakers and plants hanging off the ceiling and if you're a member, you can borrow a mat for FREE at the front desk or rent one for $5 if you're visiting. Unfortunately, the indoor gym is a little dated and stuffy due to poor ventilation while the outdoor gym has rusted weights and miscellaneous parts strewn about. However, it has a great view. (Every time I'm outside, I feel like Rocky Balboa in training, which is a very cool vibe) Plus, they spend a good chunk of their revenue on their walls, which equals to a new wall every week! YAAAASSS.If you're interested in bouldering at Grotto, I recommend Groupon or a friend's referral. Overall, my experience with Grotto has been positive (thanks in part to its supportive members and most of their staff). And after two weeks of bouldering, I definitely saw some definition in my arms and abs as well as a lack of height trepidation (my greatest fear on the first day would probably be falling to death).Parking Tip: If you don't mind walking, there's ample parking at the Park and Ride next door.", "date": "6/15/2017"}, {"review_id": "8a4tNw_HWiP3cwkYD21tXw", "user_id": "YGo2xSPQ09A2xjT7XcSujA", "user_name": "Jason G.", "business_id": "YPWvUVKWwKXd0o1xIBArfg", "stars": 5, "useful": 2, "funny": 2, "cool": 0, "text": "I don't mind comin' hereAnd spendin' all my time'Cause when I'm climbin', oh so nearI kinda lose my mind...Grotto is just what I needed! \u00a0Ok, no more Cars lyrics. \u00a0Sorry. \u00a0I'll get to the review. \u00a0Grotto is a great welcoming place for adults and kids alike. \u00a0My daughter and I got memberships at the end of last year. \u00a0We've been climbing together for a couple/few months now and loving it. \u00a0The employees are helpful and easy to talk to. \u00a0The other members/climbers are cool and happy to assist newcomers such as ourselves. \u00a0Really cool kids club and summer camps. \u00a0Ping pong table is a cool way to cool down and relax before leaving. \u00a0Highly recommend checking this place out if you are in any way curious. \u00a0Members get free guest passes to hook people up with every month. \u00a0Message me if you want to check them out for free. \u00a0I'm happy to share the love with my fellow Yelpers. \u00a0And going with me is a great way to feel good about yourself considering I'm like the weakest person and worst climber there. \u00a0You'll look and feel like a pro!", "date": "3/15/2017"}, {"review_id": "pqERMFAlaHUuppbxLKvTQw", "user_id": "axCODH6SJuMzrNXArmJwvQ", "user_name": "Dawn B.", "business_id": "YPWvUVKWwKXd0o1xIBArfg", "stars": 5, "useful": 3, "funny": 0, "cool": 2, "text": "This review is for Yoga only.

Even though I haven't climbed in 2ish weeks, I personally feel as if am still struggling on V1 routes, when at my home gym (in Washington) I could tackle V3s and V4s at this level of difficulty.

When I called to ask them to return the charges, the person I talked to told me to call the next day. I waited and called again - The person I talked to said that they would \"look into it\" and get back to me in just a few minutes. After hours of patiently waiting, I called and asked about it again, and was told by whoever picked up that they would return two of the $20 fees. I called one more time the next day to ask about the third $20 fee. This time I was told that $20 was a discounted monthly rate for my child, which makes no sense at all because I cancelled the entire thing. There were repeated attempts to reroute the conversation to make it sound like he was doing me a favor - by stating that the fee was 55 for students and military, he hinted that I owed them, which was demeaning and insulting. However, he offered to return $5 - to me this was a huge slap in the face. Then he said that he would refund $20, which was another slap in the face, especially considering the previous day I was told that two of the fees would be returned.This is not how you treat customers - if this was my store, \u00a0I would have taken my wallet out and handed you what is rightfully owed and apologized.", "date": "9/6/2016"}, {"review_id": "P0iU4YyVzllUWx9rAOj3ZA", "user_id": "1Lhd44JC0FI-cfQjRKD1oQ", "user_name": "James M.", "business_id": "YPWvUVKWwKXd0o1xIBArfg", "stars": 5, "useful": 4, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "text": "Beautiful space and fun environment.

Once a week they change out one of the walls, ensuring that there's always a new set of challenges every week. And each wall has a different configuration too: some decline, some vertical, some overhangs, all with a variety of routes for all skill levels. It can get a bit crowded in the evening, but never so crowded that you can't get a great climbing session in. Most of the time spent climbing is actually spent resting and waiting for your arms and hands to feel strong enough to try another climb anyway! The bliss hour yoga class on Tuesdays and Thursdays is the perfect blend of calming meditation and deep stretching. Lena is super professional and knowledgeable and does a terrific job leading the class. I'd only done yoga once or twice ever before this, and now it's my perfect warmup before climbing. Also the class size varies but the biggest I think it's been is maybe 12-15 people or so, usually it's closer to 8, which allows for her to really help each person individually with their form in each of the stretches.If you're interested in bouldering OR yoga, this is the place for you.

We hadn't heard much in the way of reviews because it is a fairly new gym. So when we walked in we were surprised that their main focus was bouldering rather than climbing with ropes (this is exactly what we were looking as my husband used to climb back in England and was looking for a gym exactly like this). We were pleasantly greeted by Matt (who happens to be one of the owners) who walked us through the ins and outs. I recently hurt my wrist and wasn't too sure if I would even be able to climb. Matt was kind enough to let me climb before paying which was super cool of him! (Luckily I was able to climb.)Overall the gym itself was clean, spacious and full of different leveled climbing routes to constantly challenge yourself. Staff is friendly.
