The staff is friendly, the place is clean and the climbing is FUN! I've been to quite a few climbing gyms and Mesa Rim is by far my favorite. They change their bouldering and top rope routes frequently so things don't get boring. They have a nice little shop where you can buy some gear. They have a ping pong table, a yoga room, training walls for climbing and even floor space for a little gym area where they have pull up bars, hang boards, weights, boxes and rowers. I am not a yoga fan in general (which is probably why I should be doing it, but that's besides the point)... but everyone I've talked to that does yoga says they LOVE Mesa Rim yoga so try it out! They also do a core clinic on certain days which is really hard and really fun. Check their website for class times and schedules.Another cool thing Mesa Rim does is that they host events. Whether it's a used gear swap/sale, climbing competitions, a day where you can try out different vendors etc., there's something always going on there and there is always thought behind every event planned which is awesome. They also host movie nights where they rent out a theater at the Kensington Theater and other locations to show movies like Reel Rock or No Man's Land etc. Those are probably my favorite events!Last but not least, you can bring your kid here for camp or as part of a team. There are always people walking the floor checking for safety and anytime I've seen one of their staff members working with kids (whether in a group or one on one) they're always paying attention to ensure they are climbing safely and they they are comfortable.Overall, this is a great climbing gym with great staff and my friends and I love coming here!", "date": "3/20/2019"}, {"review_id": "VUL9Daym8_xMA-XnMCu-oQ", "user_id": "sXJwXEHR64393fWO4Qdq6A", "user_name": "Kim P.", "business_id": "ShWan26H3hBpmvfE9_nTPw", "stars": 5, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "text": "Best gym in all of California.

No matter if it's your first time climbing or if you've been climbing for years, there's a little bit of everything for everyone. The very spacious gym has bouldering, top rope, and lead climbing. New routes are set weekly, so you'll always have something new to do, too. In terms of route difficulty, I would say in general Mesa Rim sets a little more difficult compared to surrounding gyms, but don't be too intimidated-- even if you're a complete beginner there are routes you'll be able to do. The downstairs fitness area has free weights (dumbbells, and barbells with bumper plates) and upstairs there are some cardio machines, so after your climb you can get your complete workout in. As you might expect, the gym gets somewhat crowded on the weekends, but I've never found my self waiting around too long to get on the walls. If you ever find yourself going to the gym solo but still want to do top rope or lead climbing, just stop by the front desk and have them make an announcement to see if anyone else is looking for a climbing partner. More often than not, there's probably someone else wandering around who needs a partner too!

We ended up try out some bouldering since we hadn't belayed anyone in a while and we couldn't make the class at 5pm, but the nice thing is there was so much to do in the bouldering area that were able to get a nice solid workout in.

It's just how their gym is ran is really what needs to be updated. The pros: great setup & place. The routes change regularly. They play good music. There is more to do than just climb. A full gym with other classes. The cons:1. Memberships are expensive! Not only that, there's an initiation fee and if you want to freeze your membership there's a fee still. 2. Gear is not included in a full membership but is in a week membership. Like what about the members that forget their gear? They have to pay. Full members don't want to live comfortably in the loaner gear anyways, so they shouldn't charge us. 3. The belay lessons are almost impossible to get into unless you really plan ahead. So if you're bringing a friend have them schedule the day before and have them go an hour before you. 4. The staff is incredibly unaccommodating! Everything is incredibly strict. Timing, rules, techniques, etc. I get it, safety is cool but come on...use discretion! The main thing that caused me to cancel my membership was that I brought a friend that has climbed and belayed with me at another gym and he failed their belay check because his atc was sideways because he used another atc a different gym, which is totally not their fault but come on, give the guy a day pass so we can climb. The main issue is this - I came in with him at 11:55 and knew they had a belay lesson at 12:00 and specifically asked the guy that if he doesn't pass your check, we can get into the 12pm belay lesson so we can climb and he said yes. We did the check and he failed because of a newbie mistake but then they wouldn't let him take the belay lesson because it was now past 12pm. Instead of any discretion, it's just a simple no because it's past 12. I specifically asked this question so we wouldn't waste our time and here we are with time wasted.

Our instructor for the day was Trevin, he was great, if were unaware on how to traverse through the climb he'd give you some pointers and even provided some motivation. Our whole group felt really safe and secure because Trevin was so professional and really wanted us to succeed and overcome our fears. I fell and thankfully but that is due to the fact that I am a bit of a klutz, I missed a rock on the way down, I landed on the bouncy flooring which I love but at least I have a battle wound to prove me conquering my fears! My fiance Bryan and our friend Heidi did a really great job climbing all the way to the top on the 60 ft walls! I did attempt to climbs on the larger walls with the harnesses and felt completely safe and secure, Trevin gave pointers on how to get down and he kept insisting that if we needed any breaks to just take them because he would have our backs!

It definitely does get crowded but never really had to wait! There are lessons that can be taken here, yoga classes too! For all ages (lessons for kids/kid classes), levels, and very friendly environment.The best in San Diego considering there are only a few.

He had previous belaying experience from other climbing gyms, but it was not exactly clear on all the fundamentals or belay requirements for this gym. The instructor was a little pretentious in pointing out the importance of rock climbing safety so the whole experience wasn't the best. I have seen other gyms handle this situation more tactfully instead of making the customer feel let down. If there was a mistake or missing fundamental, I would suggest teaching the person what is missing and not passing judgements.Rock climbing is a dangerous sport and may need to be explained in a more tactful less aggressive way in order to encourage new climbers to keep climbing.

I LOVE the idea of the kids area upstairs with a bouldering wall and tables. It's one of the main reasons I chose this gym. It's so nice to be able to have my kids color or play so I can get a few climbs in. However, today took the cake on rudeness. One of the employee's daughter came up to play too. She pulled out a box of pool noodles and kind of threw them all over the room. I figured since her mom worked there she was allowed to play with them. But my kids were not playing with them. Shortly later a woman came upstairs and announced \"whose kids are in there?!\" I said \"mine\". She says \"we need to compromise here\". Me: Um, okay? Her: That's our event center, we have events every Saturday in there, it's reserved.Me: Oh, okay I come here pretty often and I've never been asked to leave? (They usually just say the kids can't boulder while they have a class so my kids sit at the table and color) Her: You come here a lot? I've never seen you. I'm the only one working here that has kids but anyone else would ask you to leave. I'm just telling you, we need to come to a compromise here. Me: Okay. She never explained to me what this \"compromise\" was that she was looking for. But as it turns out, she was the mother of the little girl who was up there playing with the pool noodles. I can only imagine that her \"compromise\" was that she wanted to pool noodles cleaned up so they could have their class. The noodles that HER daughter pulled out. Then she disappeared for like 20 min. Once again leaving her daughter in the room, I guess she didn't have to leave for the \"event\"? But I went in and had my kids clean up (despite that they didn't get them out and weren't playing with them) and we left. I will not be returning. I will happily take my business to Vertical Hold. All this woman needed to say was hi, I just wanted to let you know we have an event starting here in about 20 min so we'll need to move your kiddos over a little while we hold the class and then they're welcome to boulder again after our class is over. I would have been like cool, no problem at all.

I went with a new friend and we got to start our top rope belay certification within 30 minutes of arriving (the class times are online, so you don't have to arrive so early like we did). The guy who taught us helped a lot, especially for me because it was my first time belaying ever, and we were ready to go climb some walls!My friend and I were instantly hooked. We signed up for memberships within the week, and we've been members ever since! Yes, it's a little pricey, but it pays for itself if you go more than 4x a month - which has been well worth it since we go about 3x a week. Plus, with membership you get challenging routes of all levels that are rotated regularly (less greasy routes! it never gets boring!), discounts on gear and classes, free yoga classes (which unfortunately I don't utilize enough because my work schedule is abnormal), a gym area centered around increasing your climbing strength, staff that are super stoked on climbing, and well-maintained facilities. Plus there's a nice little area upstairs where you can work or study if needed.I'm now at around an intermediate level in climbing, and in the 9 months I've climbed here, I've fallen in love with a new sport, increased my climbing skills and strength, have tagged along with friends on outdoor climbs, and now my friend and I are working towards getting lead certified and assembling a rack for our own outdoor climbing adventures!

We we're excited to try this place as this is new and the biggest one in SD but I guess our expectations may have been too high for this place. I'm always fair at giving reviews and look at both the good and bad side of things so let's go for the good one. This place is the biggest among all the other indoor rock climbing in SD. The walls are also higher than the others. The interior design is pretty neat and spacious and there were a couple of iPads to do waivers and signing, which, eliminates wait time... So now, let's talk about why I'm giving this place a 1 star. Right when u walk into the building, it smells like FEET. And I have A very good tolerance with smell but idk if the people inside were just immune to the smell but holy cow, it's like \u00a0the building has smelly feet air freshener. So, we go and sign the waivers and had to go thru 2 different iPads because the first two aren't working right, the touchscreen may need to be cleaned or perhaps they need to restart these devices so, yes, they may have plenty of iPads but not all are working as expected. Then, we were told by front desk that we need to take a test to ensure that we know what were doing, otherwise, wait for the next lesson (u must pay for this lesson) which is about an hour later -- that means we'd have to wait for an hour before we can even start climbing . And the funniest part for me was when she said \" u have to rent our shoes for sanitary reasons\" though, I wanted to be blunt and tell her that before she speaks about sanitation, haven't they smelled the place?\" For these reasons, we refuse to rent shoes from a place that's smelled like feet. I didn't want to be rude to the front desk as I understand they were only doing their job so we left and went back to vertical horizon. We've been going to vertical horizon and for all the times we've been there, it has never smelled like feet or even had any stench.

Once we realized that we needed an APC and everything else we needed, they started treating us with a tremendous amount of disrespect and wanted nothing more to do with us. Kemper, who was the person who we asked to give us a refresher on how to tie our figure 8s started becoming very PRETENTIOUS and rushing through the demonstration. Once done, he asked why I hadn't been paying attention. Well, I needed to be completely focused on the rope and his demonstration and didn't look him in the eye, which he took as disrespectful.... Once we got to the wall, he had completely flustered us with backwards information and technique and my partner had tied the wrong loop and I had forgot to check due to the scrutinizing I had to perform on my own gear. The reason we were so flustered is, we could feel Kemper staring at us the entire time. Once my partner finished his climb, he we started the belay process. My partner was holding onto the rope because he could feel something wasn't quite right. At about the halfway point down, Kemper came over and started instructing my partner to let go of the rope... Once my partner touched down, Kemper proceeded \u00a0with, \"So the reason I had you hold on to the rope like that is because you has tied your figure 8 through the wrong loop. My partner knew this, he was holding on to the rope for that exact reason... Kemper at this point had given us such conflicting information on how to climb at their gym that he stated that we should just go and they would give us our money back. The part that really topped off this absolute waste of time of an experience was, he said \"Well, Solid Rock is still open and around the corner, you should just go there or back to Grotto....\" The bottom line here was, they said we could have a free day pass but that would only cover the day we would have to come back and take the class they offered for $40.... This class was book work only and consisted of a paper test..... We have been to Vertical Hold, Solid Rock and Grotto and every one of these gyms has demonstrated how to properly get people on the wall and do it safely. They don't make you feel stupid or like you are getting in the way. There were 5 people at the front desk eating granola bars and talking about the girls they were checking out in Mesa Rim that evening. Kemper could have been a SOLID representative for Mesa Rim by getting us on the wall and learning their ways but this is precisely the problem. It's THEIR way or the highway and their way isn't safe, knowledgeable or beneficial. It's inconsistent and, if anything clouds the climber from being an actual safe climber because they are trying to follow their proclaimed procedure over following common sense safety precautions and practices..... I wouldn't go back even if they paid me to go back and the funny thing was, Kemper ONLY offered a free day pass the next time so we would have to SCHEDULE an APPOINTMENT and PAY for a CLASS.... These people only want their little crew of people, that is it.", "date": "1/18/2016"}, {"review_id": "znHxqV56KlN4tdianwHjsg", "user_id": "qiJMkkUD6hNIlL-z3Wx1sg", "user_name": "Martin C.", "business_id": "ShWan26H3hBpmvfE9_nTPw", "stars": 5, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "The staff are welcoming, helpful and courteous.

I am not a sports junkie, however I feel bad after a week without movement. In the past, I've done yoga, so i wanted to continue moving when I moved to the States from Europe. Each yoga studio asks at least $75 with very restricted opening hours, that are basically for stay-home people. I find forcing myself out of work for going to a peak-hour class (and not enjoying) not enjoyable. For this and many reasons, I was unhappy, because yoga studios were very expensive, parking was horrible and I had to leave work quite in advance to reach to a yoga studio... Not worth it..Then a friend of mine got me into Mesa Rim with his guest pass.. and boy I loved it! Before reviewing the place, I must say the community is fantastic. It is not a \"gym\" where people go to show off, exchange looks and judge each other. Every time I go there, even though I am a beginner, I don't feel discomfort. Climbers are very respectful for me to finish a route and helpful. Likewise, the front desk people are the friendliest. I love it! Even my husband (who is a very outdoorsy person and despised the indoor gyms) became a member on our second visit. Since I go to Mission Valley more often I will review it. The place \u00a0is very clean and maintained very professionally. Parking is never an issue. The background music playlist is awesome. There are more beginner routes upstairs (5.5 - 5.7), which does not get so crowded.
