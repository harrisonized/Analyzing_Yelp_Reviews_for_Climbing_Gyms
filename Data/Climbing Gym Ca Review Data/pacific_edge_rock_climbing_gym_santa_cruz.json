I normally Boulder, not belay, so if you are going to belay then this is a good location. It's small but the walls look immersive, but both the bouldering area and the belaying are small enough that you'll be done in about two hours. The bouldering area was...confusing to start. The routes didn't seem very well thought out for the sake of beginners, im normally a V2-V3 but I couldn't get past the V1's without cramping in my shoulders by the awkward placements of the boulders. You could tell that they were old as well, I pulled out my arm a bit and my friend almost fell from the slippery foot placements. It makes me feel spoiled at the other places I go to such as Dogpatch boulders, where it's very easy to jump right in to a route, and its easier to figure out a predetermined route before climbing. This was not the case here. The routes went across one wall, up and over and back to the original wall (not surprising since the walls were max 12 feet tall), you had to wing it along the way, which I'm sure some people are into. It's literally maybe 6 small walls so it gets crowded fast, not to mention that anyone could be walking under you and it's unavoidable due to the narrow space all around. Then there's two random rooms in the back, which if anything should be converted to the bouldering area. The one in the front is far too small and confusing. If you want to feel good and at least get 4 routes out of your day, this isn't the place. V6 and up? Go crazy, you'll have a good time with the oddly placed holds and distances. I didn't have that great of a time and I tried to make the best out of the three hours I was there. They should just invest more into the bouldering area, but what made everything fun was the people who climb there, not to mention the very kind and friendly front desk.

I can't tell you how many times I've been in a gym and seen fights break out over fitness equipment or free weights. It's disgusting.Luckily going to Pacific Edge is nothing like going to a regular gym. The people there are friendly, supportive, helpful and they're all there doing something they love...climbing really tall walls!

The problem I had stems with the employees I spoke to in person and over the phone, not the equipment.I didn't know there was yoga at the gym and called to ask if I could take the class for free today(there are a tremendous amount of yoga studios in SC that offer this). The man on the phone said I should have taken it when I came in originally. I told him I didn't know there was yoga at this gym(which adds value to this particular gym for me). He said, \"We can't answer questions you don't ask\". Swear to god! Ha. That is actually funny. How about, you tell me about your gym when I come in the first time and explain why it stands out from the rest!? I don't know, maybe a sales pitch!?

The staff and patrons [for the most part*] are friendly and engaging, encouraging and insightful, lending helpful advisement and rallying to your climbs and ascends. It's a nurturing environment and camaraderie that I think is inherent to the sport, though I think its particularly prominent here partly due to its small size. The routes & problems I attempted were rated very firmly [DISCLAIMER: I'm not a strong or adept climber, with only a few years of casual experience, as much as I enjoy the sport], and I'm told that they're quite comparable to outdoor grades. I was grunting on routes a letter grade below what I might decently climb at Planet Granite, Sunnyvale and/or Touchstone Studio, San Jose. This may be partly attributed to the height/length of some of the climbs; I found myself run out of gas just before a couple of finishes. And let's not even start with my near inability to close some of the bouldering problems. #realitycheckMy only real detraction from being able to rate this fantastic gym a better/best is more personal than objective? The smaller footprint of this gym, coupled with its legacy for fostering great climbers, left me, as a relative beginner, with fewer options. Nearly half the routes are set aside for lead-climb, there are possibly a handful of top-rope routes per rating (5.9, 5.10a/b/c/d, etc.), and bouldering problems below a V2/3 are few. Still, this is a fun gym to spend an afternoon at, but I am not a skillful enough climber to have enough to do/try to completion.But if you want to get better, you should be around better. And it goes a long way being in a environment and community that is warm and welcoming. Pacific Edge has got that vibe in spades. I'll definitely be back sometime and hopefully be strong enough to enjoy more of it!_________________________________________*Except for one guy whom I assume was a regular, whose self-perceived elitism precluded etiquette or sense of safety, beginning and climbing through his route that clearly overlapped and intersected with our friend's route while said friend was problem solving THEN telling our group WE were wrong for thinking him rude & inconsiderate.F*ck that guy.

There is enough stuff in the 5.6-5.8 and VB-V0 range for a few days of climbing, but if you come more often than a couple times a week you may start to run out of new things to try. However, I never found this to be too big of an issue since you normally progress into some of the intermediate stuff fairly quickly. If not they are pretty good at putting up new routes in a given grade every 2-3 weeks.", "date": "1/14/2009"}, {"review_id": "r0RppALhTSzf8trwBXqhCA", "user_id": "LRJgblf3U3v1MwhR7GrnfA", "user_name": "Julia W.", "business_id": "dLSkedZvkE1xldE5cwvquA", "stars": 4, "useful": 5, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "awesome, helpful staff here! \u00a0great place for learning/training. \u00a0Not overly large but some super high walls. \u00a0Climbers here tend to be a friendly bunch. \u00a0For a warm up or a bit of diversity members can exercise in the Cardio Area or the Training/Weight Room, there is even yoga.", "date": "4/26/2006"}, {"review_id": "U9GttoZQz38QjebaOML0fA", "user_id": "eCcjxh8zjAqn-kZVWZ_HJQ", "user_name": "Katie S.", "business_id": "dLSkedZvkE1xldE5cwvquA", "stars": 2, "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 2, "text": "I like to boulder more than climb vertically, so Pacific Edge doesn't really work for me. \u00a0They do have bouldering walls, but I was never really impressed by them. \u00a0Good if you like going up and down though.", "date": "1/31/2007"}, {"review_id": "6ioDyuWwoPXLk5iNMCnQTA", "user_id": "DOzHoGQ7kXvYH64mr2gUOw", "user_name": "Autumn C.", "business_id": "dLSkedZvkE1xldE5cwvquA", "stars": 5, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "You get tons for your membership.
