I like this place so much that I often travel all the way here from SF when I'm in town for work, even though I no longer live in the East Bay and there are many gyms closer to the hotel that I usually stay at. It might sound a bit odd that I would be so excited about a climbing gym when I rarely climb, but the fitness area at Ironworks is so amazing that you don't need to be a climber to visit or even become a member. I will say that the climbing and bouldering area here is HUGE, one of the biggest I've ever seen. However, I think that the real star here is the fitness area, which is also fantastic. I am a powerlifter, and Ironworks has some great equipment for both powerlifters and olympic lifters. There are plenty of squat racks, barbells, bumper plates, and other lifting accessories, in addition to lots of space to lift. There are also tons of different machines, including aerodyne bikes, concept 2 rowers, GHDs, cable machines, and a full array of standard gym machines. Additionally, there is a large stretching area with bands and other recovery items. All in all, this is one of the better gyms for serious lifters in the region. The locker rooms are great, with lots of lockers, showers, and clean stalls. The staff is super friendly. Prices are very reasonable, particularly day pass prices on weekdays before 3pm, but membership prices are great too. They have a good selection of workout drinks. The gym is located about a block from an Emery-Go-Round stop, which provides free transportation from BART. All in all, I would highly recommend this for anyone who is into their fitness, and while the name implies its mostly a climbing gym, you don't need to be into climbing at all to visit or become a member and get your money's worth.", "date": "4/27/2019"}, {"review_id": "lBJH5CVUay_O0GtRCiFMnA", "user_id": "8Wyc-4yAmRoMQo_GByJg2w", "user_name": "Olivia C.", "business_id": "e8qcVa63akVtgO-FFieb3Q", "stars": 5, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "I took Rebecca's 10:45 am Saturday yoga class.

There were 5 squat areas (one power cage, 4 squat areas in the training rig), rogue plates, a ton of weightlifting bars (including a couple of rogue Ohio bars), microplates, a deadlift jack, weightlifting belts if you didn't have your own, and a lot of mat space for deadlifting. And best of all, most of the people using the weightlifting area understood gym etiquette so it wasn't often that someone was using the squat rack to deadlift (if space permits). On top of that, BIW was constantly adding/updating their lifting equipment. I was stoked when they added a glute ham raise machine and a reverse hyper. Unfortunately I no longer live in East Bay and am currently a 24 Hour Fitness super sport member, so I am writing this review to reminisce the days where I could select which weightlifting bar I want to use and have the option of using an ohio bar...

It takes time to adjust the bike, especially when I can't reserve one ahead of time, change, maybe fill my water bottle and take a bathroom break. \u00a0Let alone, many times, there's a line and I have to wait for this number (or towels).There's so much that I love about Ironworks - proximity to my home, laid back clientele, friendly staff, diverse crowd, class offerings, amount of gym equipment. \u00a0But, the disregard for the user experience for people like me is a big dark cloud. \u00a0One that gives me pause when I hear my friends talking about how much they like their gyms.. \u00a0Seriously, if I couldn't walk to Ironworks, I'd probably be going some place else, at this point.", "date": "1/24/2019"}, {"review_id": "5fXWp7vNzVU7iB0dwh_7nQ", "user_id": "UtEcI-l-HbVeYU__a3Fq0Q", "user_name": "Anne F.", "business_id": "e8qcVa63akVtgO-FFieb3Q", "stars": 3, "useful": 2, "funny": 3, "cool": 1, "text": "My partner and I have had a membership for about 17 months, and Berkeley Ironworks was initially one of my favorite places to spend a free evening or Sunday. The staff are friendly, there's a lot of routes to climb, the yoga is great. I love the sauna. It's also worth noting that my partner and I feel very welcomed as a queer couple here. This is one of the only businesses we interact with where people seem to know that we're partners and not sisters. Thank you for that, BIW! All that being said, I've lately started to dread going to BIW and am considering cancelling my membership. It's gotten so crowded that it's hard to top rope or boulder without falling on top of people and doing a LOT of waiting for routes (I've noticed a significant change even in the short time I've been climbing here, and no it's not a seasonal change, but rather a linear increase over time). Further, with more people seems to come an uptick in condescending attitudes. While people are waiting around for routes, there's plenty or time for chit-chat about what's going on around them. I HATE hearing strangers talk to each other about how I'm climbing a top rope route while I'm actively on it. Especially when it's men doing the talking, which it usually is (\"she'll really need to get over on the right wall up there\" or \"oh I climbed that one yesterday, it was a piece of cake, I just had to mantle on the crux and then pull up the weight of my cis-male ego using that right-hand crimp.\"). Which brings me to my final complaint. Where are the women and/or non-binary route setters? They used to have short setter bios on their website, and I don't see the page there anymore. Maybe it's changed since then, but last time I looked, the setters were almost all people I read to be men (except for maybe one person?). It shows in the climbs and their ratings. 5.9s and 5.10s can sometimes actually be pretty hard for me due to primarily drawing on arm strength, while the 5.11s and 5.12s, which are supposed to be harder than 5.10s, seem to pull more on flexibility and balance and less on pure brute arm strength. I feel so confused when a 5.11c is way easier for me than than a 5.10b, which I can't even finish. I can't trust the scale to help me pick routes that will be within my ability. Maybe this is just an issue for me. I'm willing to accept that possibility. Another possibility is that the system is based on what's easier or harder, generally speaking, for men (who are doing the large bulk of the route-setting). Granted, this is a criticism that could apply to the climbing world at large and I don't think the problem is specific to BIW. Still, they could do better.

Pretty obvious.) all with a bad attitude. Usually citing some obscure reason. It COMPLETELY sours my touchstone experience for the day, and this being the 3rd time: I am considering cancelling my membership.Today, the day before thanksgiving, she cited \"holiday prices\" as a reason to charge me $10 extra dollars for guest passes of friends that I am introducing to the gym. Maybe today counts as a holiday, but I have no way to verify it because it is not posted anywhere.Honestly, the overcharges wouldnt feel like such a slight if she was a little more kind. Her stuck up attitude flavors these experiences in a really bad way. I hate to say it Kendra, if you cant be nice and pleasant to people, maybe customer service isn't for you. She represents the business, and she is represnting it poorly.For the record, everyone else I have interacted with over the years has been awesome.

The other half of the gym is dedicated to cardio, lifting, and cross fit. To describe the essence of this place, would be to call it a dream for hippies that thrive on the bohemian vibe.I joined a long time ago, and was a frequent visitor. I took a super long hiatus before coming back this year. The major change since my earlier days, was the addition of much needed shower stalls and cross fit equipment/weights. I'm far from grungy, and I prefer not to have my goodie-bits displayed in it's full, regal glory to all, so this was a welcomed change. I'm also not a cross fitter either. But besides that, no major changes.Everything is a little rough around the edges. The free weights are plenty, but they're definitely in dire need replacing. The cardio-related machines are up to date, which is great, but the exercise machines all need a little TLC (new cushions/covers). They do have a ton of different machines, thankfully.Do you remember the smell of your high school gym? The smelly culmination of unused rooms, dust, equipment, and old wood? This place smells just like that, with the frequent linger of incredible body odor. Odor of immense suffering, unable to describe the individual components that seem to violate the very law of physics.Coming at the butt crack of dawn has the advantage of not having to wait for any machine and an available parking space in their lot.", "date": "3/17/2015"}, {"review_id": "Y14IST9ixHxfM77-6kL6IA", "user_id": "4Y81J2Tdq5XAnkeYmCZ2ow", "user_name": "Nique F.", "business_id": "e8qcVa63akVtgO-FFieb3Q", "stars": 3, "useful": 23, "funny": 7, "cool": 10, "text": "I took a couple drop-in classes at Ironworks, hoping I'd like it enough to join. The monthly membership is only $73, cheap compared to the $100+ pricetags at other gyms. I'm not a climber, so this review is for classes only. If you're into climbing culture, Ironworks has all the rocks, mats, harnesses, and strongly-scented bodies to make you feel at home. I took a TRX class which was really intense (and fun!), but the room was quite small and tough to do all the movements without running into a neighbor or a wall (even though they limit capacity to 10 people per class). That said, sign up on the paper list outside the classroom door as soon as you arrive. Nobody at the front desk told me I needed to do this, so I the class filled up while I was standing around waiting for it to begin. Rookie mistake. Next I tried a spin class. If you're used to fancy spin studios like RIDE or CorePower, Ironworks spin is a different animal. The bikes seem older, and less comfortable. The class is held in an attic-like room on the 2nd floor, with no A/C. The instructor I had was clearly very athletic, but not terribly engaging or energetic. It was a VERY long hour. Clearly, the classes here are meant to supplement the climbing aspect of the gym, which seems like the main selling point for members. I should have known I'm too into the \"boutique\" workout studios, with nicely polished floors and spa-like amenties to appreciate Ironworks' casual vibe.

I'd been going on and off to the Berkeley YMCA for a few years, and recently switched over with my wife.I'm not an expert in climbing facilities (I've only been to two others, and one is owned by the same parent company as Ironworks). That being said, I'm impressed with both the size of the facility, the number of bouldering and top-roping routes available, and the frequency with which the routes change. Haven't found myself wanting for more routes.The crowd sizes are manageable. My wife and I go on Mondays and Thursdays, and it's not uncommon for us to wait or re-arrange our workout or climbing routine because someone's taking a rack or a route that we want.The crowd's also a ton younger than the YMCA, I've noticed. Lots of young families, too. I've never had children in a space where I've worked out before. It's really cute to see the tiny kids climb with reckless abandon, but I'm afraid one of these days that I'm going to fall on a six-year old.The staff is super-friendly. The folks at the front-desk are way more friendly than my past few gyms, and the staff wandering the floor are polite (even when they're chewing you out for bad belaying technique).The cardio and weights cover all of the basics - I actually found the equipment comparable to the Y (fewer cardio machines, the same variety and availability of weights). There's no pool or basketball court.My only real gripe are Ironworks' weekend hours - the gym opens at 9, which is pretty late in my book. The gym opens much earlier on the weekday.Value is pretty good. I pay $65/month, whereas I was paying $60/month for the YMCA.

In addition to keeping this gym membership, I also added a 24 Hour Fitness membership this year.24 Hour Fitness gyms get crowded, really crowded. 1 particular 24 location gets so crowded that I stopped going because I would always spend significantly more time waiting for equipment than actually working out.That never happens at BIW. At least, I haven't encountered it. If I jog here from work & only have 10 minutes to lift weights before I have to jog back to work, I lift weights for that entire 10 minutes. No waiting for equipment.Even at gym prime time (evenings, after work), I usually don't wait for cardio or weight equipment. I get in, work out & get out. Yeah, BIW is a lot more $$$ than 24, but my time is worth it.Besides, I'm still getting a discount & 50% reimbursement from my work. That helps to close the gap. BIW is also the closest gym to my work, so there's still the convenience factor.BIW is a decent gym even if you don't climb at all. The biggest negative is that parking sucks sometimes.

They make up for it with a kind merry, ruthless, bubbly kind of sadism that says, \"I hope your getting more fit, but I really enjoy hurting you.\" Which, to be honest, is an attitude more instructors need these days. This hyper-supportive bullshit is turning us into the human equivalents of doilies, both physically and emotionally. I like instructors that kick your ass and laugh about it.Their yoga staff is more benign. The kind of people that exude a sense of well-being from every deodorant-crystal-covered-pore on their bodies. Their yoga classes range from the bendy stretchy slowy kind to the fast in your face breathe-stretch-ow-holdit-holdit kind. I don't know what they call it. Vindiesel and Kowabunga or something.They also have spinning classes. But I'm not that much of a masochist, so fuck that.Besides the great classes. They have tons of walls are routes, with lots of topography. A solid bouldering section for people to check other out under the auspices of adventure sports, and great roped route for people actually there to climb ;)They have an impressive cardio area, a solid weight section, and even the floor space for Olympic lifts and machines.

When I sign up for a gym membership it's usually only for the treadmills and the workout machines but both of these options at Ironworks totally suck.I tried the old outdated machines downstairs for weights and not only are they ridiculously rusty but they make a really loud clanging sound every time I lift. Also the way the lifting area is set up is unreasonable because those who want to climb the wall will need to pass you, therefore ending up in your personal space while your lifting... Come on hasn't anyone noticed this?Downside number 2 are the totally dinosaur 70's treadmill machines that I tried to use and none of them worked and when I was making my way to the most modern treadmill someone was using it, therefore ending up on a stupid skiing elliptical machine that doesn't do squat for me.In a nutshell if you are looking for what I'm looking for in a gym then this place is not for you but by all means try it if your into this sort of thing. A heads up on cost: 1 membership at this climbing joint will set you back $71 a month if you pay for a year up front and the cheapest it ever gets if you pay up front is $65 a month, which is too high for me.So at this point I've joined PF gym, which is only 10 minutes away from my house for $10 a month and worth it for me.

Where this rock climbing gym falls short:- No lead climbing below a 5.10b. \u00a0Really?!? But there are so many climbs outdoors that are far below a 5.10. Other climbing gyms have indoor routes for 5.8s, for example, which allows lead climbers to practice clipping in, falling, managing the rope and having a second follow before heading outdoors.- Overhang obsession. A huge percentage of the rock climbing wall is continuous overhang. BIW seems to equate 5.10+ with overhang and they tend to have few interesting 5.10+ puzzles elsewhere in the gym. For years, I climbed at a gym near my work in the south bay rather than at BIW because of this. - Bouldering bottleneck. The bouldering area can get rather squishy, especially near the U-shaped area. - Outdoor etiquette lacking. Those of us who have climbed frequently outdoors would never dream of walking underneath someone's active rope because it is not considered to be safe, even when top-roping. But BIW is quite relaxed and does not teach or even suggest such etiquette. \u00a0- Class options can seem stale. When we joined BIW, they offered Pilates mat classes locally and Zumba at the downtown Oakland sister gym, Great Western Power Company. Within two months those classes were gone and they went back to very basic strength training. We were very, very disappointed.Overall, I'm happy with Berkeley Ironworks.

The gym equipment at Berkeley Ironworks is much better than at Great Western as is the climbing space. The staff is always really friendly, and I always feel comfortable trying new or difficult things here.Seriously the negative reviews I am seeing here sound crazy. I have not heard of anyone having those problems...the staff that I have seen more than once always remember my face (if not my name). The treadmills & cardio equipment are pretty good - some are older but they also have some new ones that have a cool screen on them that tracks your progress visually. The weight equipment is a bit on the older side, but still all usable...if your weights \"clang\" every time you use them...it means you're not using enough muscle control to put them down gently...not that there is something wrong with the machines.The only thing I DON'T like about it is that sometimes on weeknights there are a lot of kids there, I think for some program. And they can be pretty annoying. But I'm willing to deal with it.As for the climbing, I am still a beginner and (protip) there are a lot of beginner routes alllll the way in the back on a slab wall behind everything else.", "date": "6/22/2013"}, {"review_id": "E0YALWZ9twD55hItJ-66ew", "user_id": "NsFfswfKLCRb05F0rV3kvw", "user_name": "Ileana H.", "business_id": "e8qcVa63akVtgO-FFieb3Q", "stars": 5, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 2, "text": "I came on a Thursday afternoon 3ish and stayed until 5ish.

\u00a0It smells. \u00a0Don't even think about inhaling when tieing your shoes in the locker room, as getting your nose that close to the floor will make you puke. \u00a0Seriously it's that gross. \u00a0As others have said, most of the patrons stink (much more so than other Touchstone gyms) but that doesn't excuse the management from making an effort to clean the place every once in a while. \u00a0Even the hipsters and hippies appreciate a clean locker room and don't want to be forced to share in eachother's funk. \u00a0It is truly a funk buffet so say the least. \u00a0I used to enjoy using the sauna here....used to.To further expand on this, the sun's out guns out climbing steez is in full effect here, and apparently all the pasty scrawny white boys think chicks must dig their overdeveloped forearms and blinding pasty backfat...put on your shirt, bro. \u00a0Ever notice that it's only your belay partner noticing you and thinking you're cool? \u00a0The stench here is bad enough without you. \u00a0Also, they are apparently cool with bare feet in the workout areas, on the equipment, and on the machines..disgusting.The equipment here is ageing fast. \u00a0Some of the elliptical machines are epoxied to keep holding together, and all of the equipment is old, basic and janky. \u00a0Most of the rubber on the dumbbell handles is peeling off and all of the freeweights are constantly coming loose on the grip - very annoying.As I said, the yoga room is great, but is usually being used by a class, limiting you to a joke of a stretching area where there's usually 7 people jammed into a space that's really designed for 3 people. \u00a0It's dark, also smelly, constantly dirty, and has no mirrors. \u00a0In such a large building they could certainly figure something else out. \u00a0How much retail and couch space do they really need downstairs? \u00a0Another major downfall - the schedule of offered classes does not change here. \u00a0Ever. \u00a0Same as it was 2+ years ago. \u00a0Seriously? \u00a0Yeah. \u00a0Seriously.Finally, the children. \u00a0And please don't get me wrong on this one - it is absolutely fantastic that they have such a great kids after school program here. \u00a0I cannot emphasize that enough. \u00a0However, they need somebody that can handle them. \u00a0Without fail, with 400 lbs on the leg sled, there are 10 eight year olds working out on the finger boards, about 1.5 feet away. \u00a0Fine, I guess. \u00a0What is not cool with this is that you invariably have them playing under and hanging on the equipment on which you are trying to lower 6 times their body weight. \u00a0Not cool. \u00a0Meanwhile, their instructor is chatting up the parent that has snuck up to lean on the other side of your machine rather than trying to give you any kind of respectable (or safe!) distance. \u00a0WTF?!?! \u00a0The kids are fine, but please control them, and their parents!!There you have it - my justification for 2 stars. \u00a0The problem is that this place has so much potential. \u00a0They are raking in cash, as it is not cheap to be a member. \u00a0Maybe stop building new gyms and acquiring more property until you can handle keeping your existing facilities in the current century or at least clean. \u00a0Easily 4-5 star potential here if management made it look like they cared in the least. \u00a0Cha-ching....$$$$...bummer.", "date": "5/9/2013"}, {"review_id": "ALCtn8AsYIn9yJRsaQie2A", "user_id": "6FIHemYfJr_gUz_P3mwsag", "user_name": "Andrew M.", "business_id": "e8qcVa63akVtgO-FFieb3Q", "stars": 5, "useful": 3, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "text": "I walked into Ironworks one February night not sure if I'd physically be able to climb. \u00a0(I have Cerebral Palsy, and let's just say that climbing is not on the list of activities that people think I'm \"supposed to\" be able to do.) \u00a0I joined anyway because the environment and the energy of the place were so positive.Lo and behold, not only can I climb, but I love climbing, and I love Ironworks. \u00a0The membership in general is kind and communal, and I've very rarely met anyone who wasn't welcoming, engaging, and a good belay partner. \u00a0The staff is unbelievably good, and I've repeatedly been humbled by just how kind and giving they can be -- I've had staff members take their own personal time to give me impromptu lessons, talk to me about their own techniques and experiences, and offer support in every way possible. \u00a0The climbing clinics and classes are clear, well-taught, and designed to impart just the right amount of information without overloading the students. \u00a0The emphasis is on teaching correct technique and building the students' knowledge. \u00a0They are vigilant and passionate about safety, but they're equally passionate about giving climbers the knowledge and skills they need to climb safely and well.And yes, they do have a full set of workout equipment, which is generally available without a wait. \u00a0It's well-maintained, and very infrequently have I ever seen anything out-of-order. \u00a0Much as I love climbing things, I do sometimes take the time \"just\" to work out, and also I use the workout area to stretch.Even with all the time I've spent at Ironworks, there are still things left to explore -- the yoga and cardio classes, the saunas, the bouldering areas, etc. \u00a0I think that's one of the wonders of the place: you can do what you want and need to do, whether you're a climber or not.All in all, Ironworks is among the very best examples of what can be achieved when both the staff and the members really want to be there. \u00a0I'd recommend it for anyone looking for a supportive, welcoming environment in which to work out, and definitely for anyone looking to climb.", "date": "7/3/2013"}, {"review_id": "GMPiHLvu6VXqmA-KSaa4aw", "user_id": "UQwKeCynyroh-E6bVG3DrA", "user_name": "Sara M.", "business_id": "e8qcVa63akVtgO-FFieb3Q", "stars": 5, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "5 stars isn't enough!

One student said, as I was going up the wall, \"you know I have a D in your English class, right?!\" It was so generous of the IronWorks staff to give up their time and energy for our students.

There's a lot of equipment and machines (I'll get to those in a minute...). I hate waiting at the gym more than anything ever.- The staff seem pretty cool too, they've always been really nice and helpful. - I like the atmosphere/space and general attitude. Most people seem decent (you don't get a lot of meat heads here). The space is cool: as a huge wearhouse it is open and light without seeming too cold. Plus, you can watch people climb while working it out. Sort-of-cons: -The weights, equipment, cardio machines could use an upgrade. There are a lot of people who use them and most of the machines have seen better days. I have seen some maintenance going on but, really, I would love to see BI invest in some new cardio equipment.- This is sort of silly but I like to read when I cardio it and when I first came here, 2 years ago, there was a vast stock of magazines available for such purposes. Now you're lucky if you can find a 4 year old copy of Vegetarian Times to read. I am not sure if people take new magazines home or what ,but it would be awesome if they could get a good amount of decent subscriptions going.

I usually just wait until later when it's calmed down a little bit. And if it's too crowded on the floor, you can go up stairs and do some cardio on the machines. 4. My climbing partner is my husband, and it's nice to actually spend time together while getting in a good workout. Two birds, one stone. 5. I like climbing clothes. Unlike a lot of other athletic endeavors, you can wear cute clothes while climbing and show off your REI fashionista style! ;) Okay, a silly reason, but I like clothes to be cute in any situation. 6. While I've only taken one yoga class there, I hear the classes there are great. I'm just not organized enough to show up at the gym at a specific time.

Little punk. Yet after a little while I found myself being encouraged by surrounding climbers, letting me know which walls are easier to start on and which aren't.

I'm here almost everyday either working out or climbing. \u00a0 The things I love most about Ironworks (as opposed to the other Touchstone gyms I've been to) are the awesome, friendly, and helpful staff members; the huge cardio and weight area (as well as the view of the rock walls from the cardio and weight machines); and of course, the rad climbing. \u00a0 This Touchstone gym is larger, or at least the layout is such that it feels larger, than Great Western Power Co and Mission Cliffs. \u00a0Diablo Rock Gym is kind of far out if you're in SF or East Bay, but is comparable in size. \u00a0Haven't been to Pipeworks and MetalMark is still in the making.Other great perks not to be missed: \u00a0classes to help you improve your climbing - usually for a decent price; a huge range of fitness classes (definitely go to Wendy's spinning class on Friday am - it's an ass kicker); clean bathrooms and showers with shampoo, conditioner and bodywash; great social environment complete with competitions to test out your climbing skills; and lots of free parking.My only complaints: \u00a0(1) I wish they changed the routes a little more frequently, but that's only because I climb about 3-4 times a week; (2) I wish they had more than one \"good\" (ie newest Precor) elliptical; (3) Sometimes they take a while to get broken cardio machines back up and running.Contrary to what some reviewers say, this place does not smell and is impeccably clean. \u00a0If you smell anything, it's because someone's been climbing in their shoes for a looooong time :).

Some cons of Berkeley Ironworks and the Touchstone Gyms is it's pricey. $65.00 an month! In addition to a $100.00 initiation fee, ouch. It's definitely not cheap. In regards to being good for kids, it varies. Some days and times are good to have children there, but other times when it's crowded, not so much. The stress of safety is so paramount there, that one little distraction from a kid can mean a belayer potentially doing a dangerous thing to his climbing partner.

Given my concerns, I was impressed by her attention to proper technique and injury prevention, and the fact that I heard a lot more about \"stretching your latissimus dorsi\" than I did about \"finding your center\". Sadie also made a point of relating many of the moves and muscles to climbing skills. As a beginner and a math/science guy by background, those descriptions really helped build comfort and credibility. The range of equipment available was also impressive.This was also the first time I showered here rather than at home, which gave me a new perspective on the locker room. The textured stone floor gave excellent traction even wet from the showers, which are communal (no stalls), much like in high school.

My experience here has been positive, as is evidenced by the fact that I have been climbing here once or twice a week for almost two years now. I find it affordable. I tend to buy the ten-passes but have also had the membership when it was cost-effective for how often I was going. I also find it laid back and just the right balance of clean enough but not sterile-looking or upscale. It draws the kind of people I like to play (read: climb) around and I have met some of my favorite people in the area here.BIW executes their business largely with grace. But, it IS a business with different kinds of people as customers and staff - and rules to follow. But, you want total DIY freedom, go outside! While I do often roll my eyes when I see staff repeatedly walking past eagle-eyeing my rope management, deep down I obviously appreciate knowing that they are watching so that sloppy or distracted folks (could be me, too, but I don't think it is) won't fall \u00a0- on me, near me, at all, yuck. I overheard a beginner class once while climbing nearby, and enjoyed it. The teacher was clear and engaging and made me think about my belay operation in a way I liked. I see a lot of beginners and parents with kids climbing here, which is great.The place is hopping in the evening after work hours, and is tranquil and sparse during the day. I like to watch the elite climbers ballet dancing up the wall in the lead-climbing cave, the ladies in full makeup who sweat it out on the stairmaster like champs, the beginner climbers in rental equipment being coached by friends on how to actually come back down after they get to the top, and young and old bad-sses alike playing acrobat in the bouldering cave. Sure I have met some people who were self-absorbed or oblivious to the line as they did laps on a route, but this has been rare, I can honestly say.I like the big warehouse windows and sliding bar doors that slide open to air out the place on warm days, and the continuously circulating artwork by local artists. I like the new women's showers and the quiet wood sauna in the locker room where I like to bake after getting worked over by the overhangs. The non-climbing wall workout facilities are cozy but effective and comprehensive, though I don't use them much.

I spend more time here than any single location besides my home. Sure the mats under the climbing areas are chalky and not all of the staff are outgoing, but it's a great community and the facilities and classes are amazing. It's the most fun you can have working up a sweat in a public building. Second, that European guy in spandex is French. The spandex is a holdover from the 80s when regular men's jeans were super tight and shorts were really short - and climbers didn't have their own clothing companies - so they borrowed stretchy tights from cyclists. Nowadays most climbing guys wear loose pants or long shorts with gussetted crotches or some stretch in the fabric \u00a0so they can move. But I bet most climbers over 40 have some embarrassing photos of their neon pink and green butts from that era. Third, just about anyone who is willing to work at it can be a great climber - you don't have to have a certain body type or excellent fitness when you start out. I can't honestly say I've ever seen an obese climber, probably because it's hard to develop enough grip strength to support that much body weight for long. But I HAVE seen excellent climbers who are somewhat overweight, who are over 60, who are very short, etc. But don't be afraid if you can't do pull-ups! Climbing is more about skill and technique than strength, especially when you're just starting out. I did eventually get strong enough to do pull-ups from climbing, but I was climbing overhangs when I was a weak slip of a girl. If you just keep trying patiently, the wall and your fellow climbers will teach you what you need to know, and you will get stronger. Big lesson number one - get your feet higher and use your legs to push you up. Fourth, climbers at Ironworks are really supportive and any competition is friendly. \u00a0No matter what level you climb at, people will be cheering you on. Fifth, if you keep coming to Ironworks, you will become one of those super hot fit people. As for the crowds, the parent company (Touchstone) just opened a new climbing gym about 3 miles away in Oakland called Great Western Power Company - just drive down San Pablo and take a left on 20th, look for the big smokestack.

We all love climbing. That wont get you stars. Yes its social and the people are fun so one star for that. One star for large facility with a variety of routes and interesting classes. One star because its not terrible. But I really have not much more to say about this. As a monthly member the dues are very high and more often than not it is so crowded an night at the climbing gym becomes an all night thing. Thats cool. I could hang out here all night, but sometimes you just want to do your thing you are there to do, be that climb or \u00a0use the very old and questionable other gym facilities or the pretty decent yoga classes. Personally I thought I would fall in love after going a few times and enjoying the social aspect, but realistically speaking unless climbing is your lifestyle this isn't a great place to belong to because you will be there all night and not get alot of climbing in.
