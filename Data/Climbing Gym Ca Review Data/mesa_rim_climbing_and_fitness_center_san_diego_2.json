The members are friendly (and such good eye candy!) It's a non judgmental space. They have a slack line. There are tables you can do laptop work on. You get 10% off merchandise as a member.

My friend got me into climbing and instead of doing the one day $25 pass, I decided to pay around $60 for a 2 week trial because if I came even 3 times out of the 2 weeks, it's already a way better deal. With that said, within the 2 weeks, I probably went at least 7-8 times. Not only was it worth the $60, but you REALLY see yourself progressing even in that small period of time and you simply get addicted to the art of climbing. After those 2 weeks of seeing gradual progress, I knew I had to get a pass because there was no way I wanted to stop there. A common thing that people are skeptical about is the membership price at Mesa Rim because it's about $75 per month + an initiation fee of $50. HOWEVER, I must tell you, it's completely worth it!! Also, if you find 3-4 (?) people to sign up with, you can get your initiation fee waived and there are also alternative ways to get it waived, such as buying different climbing packages, or paying for the next couple of months upfront. Although pricey, what this gym offers is completely worth it and from my own experiences, coming here has made me feel happier and better as a person - no joke.NOTE: I believe that around May, the membership will jump from $75 to ~$81 sooo... SIGN UP NOW!Firstly, the climbing community is probably the friendliest bunch I've ever encountered. EVERYONE is so encouraging and helpful -they all build you up and want you to succeed, even strangers. The people who work here are all extremely nice and welcoming too. The overall quality of the gym itself is freaking nice. In addition to bouldering and top roping, there is also a weight area with a squat rack, some tread mills, weights, other machinery and some fun aerodynamic ceiling activities. There's also an upstairs portion with a ping pong table, fooz ball, other tools to help you work out your body, & even tables and sofas for you if you'd like to study. There's also FREE & RELIABLE WIFI throughout the venue that is consistent and FAST!! They also provide various classes like yoga and some intense core work out classes that are very fun. There's also a sauna and showers in the bathroom! I feel like I'm going overboard with these \"also's\", but I just can't help it. Last one I promise.. but they also have slack lining where you can practice. Overall, I seriously love this place. I'm still a weak climber, but being able to see my progress as days go by has really boosted me up as a person, both physically and mentally.

I decide during the walk to my car which Mesa Rim to go to (another plus), and start my morning with a podcast and some hopeful attempts on the bouldering wall. Just like the previous reviews, everyone is pretty chill and nice. The facility is clean. Each location has a variety of routes and levels. They offer yoga and basic gym amenities that you expect. I love the quirks of both locations. I think it's awesome that the Mira Mesa one has a foosball table, and the Mission Valley one has a bookshelf of tradable reads. The membership is pretty pricey, but I think if you use it to your advantage it's worth it. Yes, a lot of people are amazing and intimidating. Yes, everyone is good looking and hip (to add on to the intimidation). But the climbing community is more often than not, some of the friendliest people. I have been a member for almost 3 months and recently I saw a whisper of progress. I still shy around and fall like an incredible fool but that small change in progress made me feel like Rocky Balboa running up the stairs.

I've been to a few yoga classes and they have been very good. I haven't used the training center yet but it looks to be full of good equipment and training walls to get you going. I think the cost of membership is well worth what you get.They are opening up a new location in Mission Valley so I am looking forward to going more often since it will be about 15 minutes closer.

My sister pretty much had her pick of any of the toprope routes and I had nearly uncontested bouldering problem options (not that the bouldering walls are that extensive...).I was impressed enough with the facility to spring for a ten-pack pass. It was slightly more economical, now that my parents are retiring to La Jolla. Considering they never expire and I'm sure to be back out this way to visit the family in the coming years, I figure I'll eventually make use of them. Plus, we were allowed to convert our day passes into the 10-pack and just deduct the day's visits from the number of punches remaining. Good deal!On my second visit to Mesa Rim, the day after Christmas, I had an opportunity to experience the tall wall climbing, and damn are the routes -tall-! Compared to my home gym in NYC (The Cliffs), all of the climbs here are about twice the height of the ones I'm used to. Which means they're both extra fun and doubly exhausting. Additionally, I'm used to much more straightforward route-setting, where I don't spend much time contemplating the specific beta required to climb .10s and .11s. I love that the setters here put in much more technical moves. While it slows down my climbing, the problem-solving required offers much more entertainment value than the pump-fest I'm accustomed to.Now, I just need to come back with a sport leading partner so I can explore some of the overhanging cave routes. They looked incredibly fun, and I love a good roof/overhang to fall into space from!If I were a local, I could totally see making this my home gym.

We we're excited to try this place as this is new and the biggest one in SD but I guess our expectations may have been too high for this place. I'm always fair at giving reviews and look at both the good and bad side of things so let's go for the good one. This place is the biggest among all the other indoor rock climbing in SD. The walls are also higher than the others. The interior design is pretty neat and spacious and there were a couple of iPads to do waivers and signing, which, eliminates wait time... So now, let's talk about why I'm giving this place a 1 star. Right when u walk into the building, it smells like FEET. And I have A very good tolerance with smell but idk if the people inside were just immune to the smell but holy cow, it's like \u00a0the building has smelly feet air freshener. So, we go and sign the waivers and had to go thru 2 different iPads because the first two aren't working right, the touchscreen may need to be cleaned or perhaps they need to restart these devices so, yes, they may have plenty of iPads but not all are working as expected. Then, we were told by front desk that we need to take a test to ensure that we know what were doing, otherwise, wait for the next lesson (u must pay for this lesson) which is about an hour later -- that means we'd have to wait for an hour before we can even start climbing . And the funniest part for me was when she said \" u have to rent our shoes for sanitary reasons\" though, I wanted to be blunt and tell her that before she speaks about sanitation, haven't they smelled the place?\" For these reasons, we refuse to rent shoes from a place that's smelled like feet. I didn't want to be rude to the front desk as I understand they were only doing their job so we left and went back to vertical horizon. We've been going to vertical horizon and for all the times we've been there, it has never smelled like feet or even had any stench.

Don't give too much slack and don't short rope the climber.\" \u00a0Sounds easy enough, but it's a different beast compared with what I was used to top roping.

I say this with some hesitation because Sender One is pretty awesome too. However, Mesa Rim does have some additional features that give it this title.1. Mesa Rim's walls go up to 55 feet high, which is slightly higher than Sender One (50 feet). The gym is also more spacious, at 30,000 square feet compared to Sender One's 25,000.2. Mesa Rim's routes are amazingly well-organized. The holds are colored and taped to make the routes extra clear. In addition, each route is rated on various different attributes, such as quality, technicality, pumpiness, etc. The rating cards are all printed and laminated. I haven't found this level of organization and professionalism at any other climbing gym.3. There is a large variety of routes and many different wall features that make the climbs more fun and interesting. I climbed the most amusing and bizarre route here. There is a spire that contains many routes. I started one route on there, and got really confused as to where I was supposed to go. I soon realized that I was to spiral around and around the spire...it was definitely a very strenuous route! You won't find that anywhere else.The climbs here are pretty easy compared to most Socal gyms. It's on par with Planet Granite and Sender One. When I climbed here quite a long time ago, I was climbing at mostly around the 5.10d level. 4. The facility is clean and well-ventilated, and the holds are all of high quality. The bathroom even has saunas.5. Mesa Rim boasts some interesting \"extras\" that are not found in many other climbing gyms, such as a slackline and auto-belaying capabilities.6. Mesa Rim even has a fake real rock wall! Yeah that's kind of an oxymoron but it's true too...it's a wall that is made to mimic outdoor rocks. It's a lot shorter but definitely fun, and some of the routes are pretty challenging! This is great because it teaches people who mostly climb indoors to look for holds, rather than always having it \"served\" to you.Verdict: This gym definitely has the WOW factor, at least for top-ropers and lead climbers. It's spacious and well-maintained. The walls are tall, the routes are interesting, and the \"special features\" are amazing. It's a must visit for anyone who likes to climb indoors.", "date": "12/20/2013"}, {"review_id": "aLXKtC1nNMvWF8IQKQwtcQ", "user_id": "43sDbJKXQwCdvjt88TFjJA", "user_name": "Michelle M.", "business_id": "mmoy-s1s3LEmgQOFJ4yc5A", "stars": 4, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "This is a pretty awesome place to rock climb, boulder, yoga, and workout. \u00a0There are a bunch of routes at many different levels, and these change from time to time for new problems to solve. \u00a0There are also several autobelays if you don't have a belayer. \u00a0Rock climbing is a great workout and definitely breaks a good sweat. \u00a0If you want a break, a ping pong table and table soccer are setup upstairs as well as a lounge area.There are times that this gym gets very busy (weekdays after work/dinner) that you would need to wait to top rope or lead climb. \u00a0Just watch out above you as some belayers do not give a heads up that their climber is getting lowered.", "date": "12/8/2014"}, {"review_id": "WXY1G9tYO6E_8mVOHCFWJw", "user_id": "mGpRDDazqTZU1w46vjGNCg", "user_name": "Sara B.", "business_id": "mmoy-s1s3LEmgQOFJ4yc5A", "stars": 3, "useful": 2, "funny": 2, "cool": 1, "text": "Comparison to Vertical Hold and Review: I came here with some friends who are members.

The lesson was really good, they were really informative, and broke down each and every step in a manner that was easy to understand. \u00a0They were friendly throughout the process. \u00a0The test itself was pretty straightforward and not really a test as it is a formality...easy to pass after their instruction, no sweat. \u00a0Just remember \"Belay...Belay On\", \"Climb...Climb on!\", hehe. \u00a0 \u00a0After the test, you're free to climb away and use their different climbing walls and routes. \u00a0They have a great selection of walls and routes to choose from, with varying levels. \u00a0I particularly like how high some of the walls go, compared to other gyms I've seen. \u00a0I'm sure to the avid climber, its more the difficulty of the routes as opposed to the height that matters, but I just thought it was fun to scale a wall so high. \u00a0Like any gym, there are dead times and peak times to go, in terms of crowds. \u00a0It can get pretty crowded during after work hours (5-8pm). \u00a0Weekends are pretty busy as well. \u00a0Overall, even during the busy times, I didn't feel I had to wait too long to wait for an open rope. \u00a0The gym is a pretty large space, so there's plenty of room for everyone. \u00a0I didn't feel too crammed in. \u00a0This gym also has some workout machines and treadmills, so its meant to be complete gym. \u00a0I think they also offer yoga classes, etc if you're into that.

I've been climbing for well over a decade. I've managed a rock gym, guided outdoor climbing trips, and am a certified setter. The issue with Mesa is that they cant ever seem to be on top of the ball. Both me and my partner have gotten belay certified for both top ropes and lead climbing multiple times, but every time we come in we are forced to go through the whole testing process again and again and again because they cant seem to keep a straight record of tested belayers. This time was by far the worst test i have taken:First off they force you to use a belay technique called the BUS. I have been tested before at Mesa and commended by their staff on my belay technique. i use the Pinch technique which has been used for over 30 years and is BY FAR the most commonly used belay technique at the moment. But during this test they forced me and my partner to use the BUS and said that they were \"trying to evolve the sport\". Excuse me? You've been around barely a year and you're at \"the forefront of the sport\"??? Never mind the fact that NO OTHER GYM IN THE AREA takes this my-way-or-the-highway attitude when it comes to belay techniques. Before we even began the test the employee who was testing us stood on my rope TWICE. That is rule number one in rope ownership, you dont step on the rope... and you especially dont step one someone else's rope. I started to lead climb. The first clip was set up incorrectly (gate facing the climb) so i back clipped it in a way that made it safer. The tester called me out on a back clip, i explained to him that in fact the draw was set up improperly. So he asked me to play along for the sake of the test. The fall that they had set up was pretty unsafe too: a fairly good whipper on a vertical wall. My partner took the fall without a problem and because of my partner's experience i was not scared, but for less experienced leaders that fall could turn out badly.When we were done with the test we were so frustrated that we didn't even want to climb anymore. My partner got her money back for the 10 visit punch card she got that day. And we went and had a beer to forget the whole ordeal. I will most likely never climb there again. Vertical Hold is far cheaper and friendlier than Mesa. Plus i wont have to deal with being told that im \"unsafe\" for climbing the way me and all of my friends climb, and for that matter most of the sport.------Mesa if you want my business again then stop forcing the new technique and get some employees that know a little more about climbing-----On a side not: i understand the appeal of using the BUS technique: The brake hand is in the brake position far more frequently than the Pinch technique. I understand if Mesa wants to teach this new, dummy proof, method of belaying to the new people coming into the sport. But you cant nullify a technique that has been used and accepted, and still is accepted, the world over. Go climb outside in CA and you will see that the majority of belayers use the Pinch method.", "date": "9/4/2011"}, {"review_id": "eqkcdt94_g2xNFBeiCx7jg", "user_id": "3uR1JrMD6P9ltOx9jLtgcQ", "user_name": "Jenny K.", "business_id": "mmoy-s1s3LEmgQOFJ4yc5A", "stars": 5, "useful": 2, "funny": 1, "cool": 1, "text": "The walls are so high!

Not here!As far as the facility, it's 10 stars. The routes are all easily marked, pretty much all of the holds are the same color so you don't need to even pay attention to the tape. The holds are not grimy like other gyms in SD.The floor is all padded carpet, so there's no dust in the air like other gyms with gravel floors. They actually care about your safety here too. All of the ropes are clean and taken care of. And you have to pass a fairly comprehensive belay test to be able to belay. But if you don't have anyone to belay you that's fine because there are quite a few auto belays. The bouldering area is 4 out of 5 stars only because they don't have any \"top out\" bouldering. You just down climb it jump off onto the well padded floor. But the problems are creative and well maintained. They have brushes lying around to scrub off holds if they're a little too chalked up. My only complaint, if you can call it that, is that it's a bit more expensive than other gyms.

He gave me a pass for a day and suggested I try out the gym. \u00a0I had no idea in reality what a rock climbing was at the time as pictures I had seen showed a simple rock face wall with rocks attached for one to hold on to while climbing. \u00a0I knew one person in to rock climbing and the strength he had must have partly come from this sport. \u00a0Since I had some problems with a pinched nerve limiting my jiujitsu at the time I called Mesarim and spoke with Daton, and to be honest, never looked back(just looked up to the next hold). I came down that weekday afternoon. \u00a0Daton asked me to go over to the computer to fill out the waiver which I did. When I saw the word \"belay\" in the waiver I had to figure out what it meant in a rock climbing gym as the only time I heard that word is when Commander Tucker told the bridge crew to belay an order of T'Pal. \u00a0After that Daton took me around and showed me the gym and I was simply overwhelmed by two major things. First I never imagined that indoor rock climbing was such an involved sport, and second, that this was such a tremendous facility where it had to take a lot of hours to set up this super realistic climbing experience. I watched people climbing, belaying, and bouldering and was simply overwhelmed. This was for me! \u00a0I had scheduled a belay lesson and when I went to take it found out I was the only one. No problem whatsoever. Many other businesses would have said sorry, we don't have enough for a class. Not so here, Bill gave me very detailed hands on instruction on being a climber and belayer. To say I was hooked was an understatement. \u00a0Even though I didn't get more than twice my height that first night, it was a totally new experience that I knew I would enjoy. \u00a0I joined the following week on their $140 beginner package (which i am on now) which includes one month membership of unlimited gym use, 3 ninety minute classes (footwork, climbing, dynamics), a belay lesson, all equipment rentals for the month, and even a guest pass. If I become a member before the month is out (which I plan to do) no initiation fee to pay, just the regular membership which now includes yoga as well. The facility is open Sunday through Saturday, 7 days a week and never closes before 9pm (11pm Monday through Thursday, 10pm Fridays). \u00a0I came back to start this membership June4 and took the first of 2 classes with Brian whose climbing knowledge is excellent, even adapting to my severe hip arthritis when I had to climb. \u00a0There are no ego's in this gym; the 5.11 climbers not only do not look down at the 5.4 climbers (unless they are climbing and you are belaying them and they want to be lowered) in any manner, in fact several have offered to belay me on my climbs even though I had never met them before. Staff members have given me beta to assist me, especially when TrueBlu is my belayer. My inquiries thru their website were always answered by the next business day. Unlike many other places, no one was pushy in any way about joining, they let the property speak for itself. \u00a0I took my first Yoga class Sunday this week (6/16) and afterwards I made it to the top of my first 5.4 (about 11m - they have walls of 6m to 17m) as well as finally doing the VB in bouldering. Not very much to any seasoned climber but for me I am happy. \u00a0I wish I knew the names of all the very helpful staff any time I had a question. Daton, Hunter, Bill, Keegan, Alexandra, Debbie, Peggy, The Sunday Yoga Instructor, forgot her name) , the other front desk staff, and Parker \u00a0were all helpful to me. In addition the place is very well organized. I have been the lead hourly employee in charge of a school building and a train station and can easily \u00a0tell when things are being done in an orderly manner or being done in a sloppy manner. Mesarim keeps on top of things and maintenance and cleanliness is up to date. Of course no place is perfect, they could use more lockers in the Men's room and an additional wastebasket for the paper \u00a0towels there, and a second drinking fountain near the teaching wall would be helpful. \u00a0I have used there weight room as well which is clean and adequate. They have an upstairs lounge and wi-fi facilities as well. \u00a0The only problem I might encounter is if my old car gives out as transit access is limited (bus 921 to Flanders and Mira Mesa) but even if this happens I will use my meetup groups and find a carpool. \u00a0This place has me climbing the walls (literally) and even if I get stuck between a rock and a hard place(this can happen even on a 5.4), I will find a hold or a way to get to the top. \u00a0For those of you who want to tell how authentic I am here, just look up (the wall) \u00a0for me or better yet, join Mesa Rim and belay me.

Nothing against new climbers (everyone should try it out; it's a fantastic hobby), I just found there to be a lack of information on Yelp about the nuances of the climbing gyms when I moved to San Diego, so I'm hoping to fill that void.If you're a climber who just moved to San Diego, particularly the northern part, you're probably choosing between Mesa Rim and Vertical Hold as your climbing gym, so I'm going to offer a lot of comparisons between the two. I haven't heard great things about Solid Rock, but I've also never been there, so I'm not qualified to comment on it. I've been climbing at both Mesa and V-Hold many times. In the interest of full disclosure, I chose V-Hold over Mesa Rim, so I may be slightly biased. Starting with the facts, before moving onto opinions, here's what Mesa Rim has to offer:-Incredibly tall walls. 55 ft, I do believe. The height is downright impressive, and almost double what V-Hold has to offer.-Basically all top-rope routes are leadable as well. This is good in that you get more options, but bad in that there's only a fairly small section dedicated to lead only.-Full coverage padded floors in the bouldering area. No need to drag mats around.-Pro shop for climbing gear (with 10% discount for members).-Very respectable gym (weights, machines, cardio, etc.), at least by climbing gym standards.-An abundance of yoga and other clinics (for an extra charge).-A \"natural feature\" wall that emulates real rock. It's cool, but it's also very short (20 ft maybe?).-A lounge if you want to hang out.Now, here are the drawbacks of Mesa Rim:-It's significantly more expensive than V-Hold, especially if you want the yoga membership as well (V-Hold offers free yoga twice a week, though not the same quality [or quantity] as what Mesa has). You also have to bring your own rope to lead or pay to rent one.-The quantity and quality of bouldering at Mesa is inferior to V-Hold. This is not subjective; it's a fact. How inferior is up for debate, but the bouldering at V-Hold is clearly better.-The parking at Mesa sucks. The lot is smaller and everything is tight and narrow. The V-Hold lot occasionally fills up during peak times too, but the Mesa lot is far worse.-Technically, they have a system board, but it's usually set up as a core board, which is kind of cool, but ummm, there should be a system board at a climbing gym. They do have a campus and finger board though.On to the more subjective matters:-I like the sets at V-Hold way better than Mesa. I think V-Hold compensates for their short walls with more interesting routes whereas it seems like Mesa is content to just have really tall walls with fairly uninspired sets. But I do know climbers who like the sets at Mesa better. From a more objective standpoint, the sets at Mesa tend to be more about sequencing (and are probably more true to outdoor climbing style in that regard) while the sets at V-Hold tend to focus more on the individual moves (I've heard their TR/lead routes described as bouldery, and I think that's a fair description).-I like the staff at V-Hold better. In my opinion, they're more friendly and, more importantly, they seem to be more on their game. Some of the Mesa desk staff comes off as sort of aloof .-I like the clientele at V-Hold better. Now we're delving into the extremely subjective, but I just feel like the regulars who climb at V-Hold are more passionate about climbing, while Mesa seems to be more about being seen. This is absolutely a gross generalization, and clearly does not apply to everyone, but I don't really know how else to describe it. I just like the vibe at V-Hold better.In summary (congrats if you're made it this far): If bouldering is your thing, go to V-Hold. If top-roping is your thing, you're probably going to be happier at Mesa. If sport is your thing, well... you've got a tough decision to make. Mesa does have all the bells and whistles, so if you're looking for the gym equipment and yoga, it has all that, but I like V-Hold better from a pure climbing perspective. Check both gyms out; they both have a lot to offer (how great is it that you get a choice here in San Diego instead of being relegated to the only climbing gym in town???).", "date": "4/7/2012"}, {"review_id": "pblUR8rtJj7fa-EH4B9kiA", "user_id": "pNTAqgkrsW7pLfEf7HIgZg", "user_name": "Shawn H.", "business_id": "mmoy-s1s3LEmgQOFJ4yc5A", "stars": 5, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Wow - What an awesome gym!

The 55 foot high walls are a lot like climbing outdoors. You even have the option to climb with your own gear. The climbing routes are easier than other places, but that's because the climbs are so long. The floor is soft and bouncy and the boulder area has a pillow soft cushioning on the floor.

I started climbing about 9 months ago and had been going top roping and bouldering at other indoor gyms in San Diego with an occasional 1 month pass when I had enough time to climb my money's worth.Yesterday was my first time at Mesa Rim, and to be honest, I didn't expect it to be that great. I LOVE this place.I'm a little on the short side (allllllmost 5'3\") and usually have a bit of trouble with some routes at the other gyms, even the easy ones, but not because it's difficult, it's because the next colored tag is half my body's length away! At Mesa Rim, there are SO many routes, so many options at so many levels! Mesa Rim routes are fun, challenging, well diversified and have routes that a shorty like me can do, without sacrificing complexity or skill (I went with my 5'11\" friend and it was nice to see that he couldn't just use his long legs and arms as the only advantage, and the more skill was required of him). I think the routes are a bit more challenging than solid rock and vertical hold (a 5.8 felt like a 5.10a at solid) but they've also got some awesome ones for beginners to work up to the harder ones. Also, the walls are hiiiiiiigh!The staff is also very friendly, attentive and HELPFUL (thanks Leslie!). We did have to wait a little to get tested that we know all the basics before we could start climbing, but I have no problem with them ensuring my knowledge and safety. Also, there was a big group that came in a little before us, and they were getting a little extra attention so that they could climb safely. I appreciate that, but having a little more staff on hand would probably be better for people who aren't as patient as I am.ALSO, they have a SAUNA, exercise bikes, a great lifting area, a lounge upstairs, a child's play area and bean bags.Only thing is, it's a little too pricey for me to get a membership, but considering their awesome facility, my friend and I are thinking of canceling our gym membership and just getting an annual at Mesa Rim.

Expertly set routes that change due to a full time staff of setters unlike many other gym's where the employee's and local community volunteer time. The padding isgreat and the bouldering is just a little bit taller than most oare used to for gyms which I love. A full weight and exercise area full with finger and strength training. A yoga area and raised platform for lounging and getting away from it all that make this the most complete, fully functioning gym in Southern California. A shower, they don't segregate area's. The pricing is a little steep, but compared to what you get it's worth it. My only real gripe is the airspace. I noticed that when you have a ton of people on ropes the amount of area in, around, behind certain routes is clustered. In other words if you were to have every route in use at the same time there is a very small area for belayers and climbers to maneuver for lowering and pendulums and such. This is minimized by expert setting with brand new holds, color coded as well as taped and expertly rated. Ian McIntosh is the head setter and keeps a tight ship. They are so cool, new and legit they are able to hold comp's which is something that's been missing for years in the San Diego climbing scene. The only thing i can say that's in any way negative is my last outting I pulled a tendon and now have a ganglion cyst that's kept me from really climbing anything juggy or past vertival. The setting of the boulder problems seems a bit sandbagged. After recovering from another injury for many months and gaining 30 pounds I was still able to boulder at V2/V3 range when my peak was V5 outside.

They did it again! They made me belay test AGAIN because they didn't have me on file!!! While redoing my belay test and throwing in a lead climbing test too, the employee made me switch my pinch belay style (widely accepted and safe) to their gym mandated BUS technique. That's funny bc during my Nth time belay tested, an employee told me I have great (pinch) belay technique! I'm completely confident in outdoor lead belaying with my own technique but I understand the gym's need for a consistent and dummy-proof method for noobs. I feel like a gym staffed by skilled climbers should recognize a climber's comfort and safety awareness instead of imposing a blanket rule, but whatever, I went along. I understand BUS keeps you braked more consistently, but there's nothing wrong or impractical about the pinch. In all, it's HOW Mesa handled all this that led me to give them a one star. This is a gym for noobs and gym rats who are impressed by the big and shiny facility, as opposed to a real climber's plastic hangout.While touting Mesa Rim's desire to \"change the face of climbing\" and \"being at the forefront of safety\" (gag, how long have you been around, Mesa Rim?), the employee managed to step on our personal rope TWICE!!! Our brand new, beautiful 70m rope that keeps us alive at the crag. AND during the lead test, the employee told my partner he back clipped. My partner, a certified route setter who helped forerun (rate/critique) Mesa Rim's boulder problems before their grand opening and climbed in their grand opening 5.13 invitational, told him that the draw was set on backwards for their lead test route, which would cause a more dangerous fall. He was essentially anti back clipping! The employee recognized the error but insisted that my partner \"play along\" for the sake of the test anyway. Lastly, the test fall/whipper on lead is set up dangerously, in my opinion. The last draw that you're supposed to fall from is quite run out considering you're falling on a straight vertical wall, meaning it's likely you'll slam into the wall. Luckily, I knew how to fall and kick off the wall and my partner gave me a soft fall, but I don't think it's wise to set up the test route that way. We griped to the manager about all this and while I commend his desire to teach the more dummy-proof belay method to new climbers, we didn't really appreciate the general vibe there. He started name dropping all these Bay Area gyms and what the guiding associations say and all that. That's cute because I've been to NorCal gyms, heck, we've even set routes there, and we've never encoutered such a patronizing attitude in the climbing community as we have at this gym. I understand if you have the corporate policy to follow, but don't act like our climbing experience is beneath you. I've been in gyms in Alaska, NorCal, and SoCal, and nobody has had the \"my way or the highway\" or \"we're trying to change climbing\" attitude. Get off your high horse, Mesa. Maybe this is why Mesa Rim can't adopt the real outdoor climbing community because of the bullshit like this. Oh yeah, and their fabulous BUS belay style is inconsistently taught. Half the time, the employee will teach you the style that requires switching the hands on brake, something the manager insists shouldn't be done. That's funny how they got Nazi on our belay style while the noobs next to us were letting go of their brake hands all the time! Yet they're \"certified\" to belay! After 2 hrs of driving from OC to Mesa Rim and just 1 hr of climbing, we basically said \"screw this\" and I asked for my money back on my multi-visit card. Such a waste of time!

You don't need any added motivation to get out to the gym several times a week and work your body to exhaustion on a wall. But with Mesa Rim, you will literally want to drag your enfeebled body back as soon as the lactic acid stops oozing out of your aching muscles, because the facility, the staff, and the vibe are just that good. One reviewer referred to Mesa Rim as the Walmart of climbing gyms, but it's more like the Bellagio of climbing gyms. Yes, it is very LARGE, but every last detail was conceived and executed with the level of care and design usually reserved for luxury resorts. Even the bathroom is a welcoming and aesthetically pleasing space. But the gym isn't just beautiful to look at and pleasant to be in, the climbing is unmatched. The walls are TALL, and the routes are masterfully set - they are deliberate and have a great sense of pace. The bouldering section is amazing. The entire area has a padded floor, so you never have to worry about landing on a crash pad, you can focus all your mental energy on climbing. \u00a0The gym has great ventilation, so body odor is not as much of a problem as other gyms, although the walls are so tall that sometimes you'll find that you literally climb above the cooler, air-conditioned climate your partner is belaying you from and get stuck in a pocket of heat at the top of a route, which is not so much annoying as it is hilarious. The music selection is varied and appropriate - it seems to rotate between alternative rock and energetic electronica. While the gym is very large and there are numerous routes to choose from, it can get extremely crowded on weekday nights. Some will find that they can harness the vibe and energy of being surrounded by so many enthusiastic climbers and use it to their advantage, while others will be overwhelmed and agitated by the abundance of bodies both on the walls and on the floors. The staff is wonderful. They are legitimately caring and involved in making sure that each new member is safe. On that note, the certification process can be tougher than other gyms, and they won't hesitate to fail you, so be prepared to take your certification and/or lesson seriously. This is with good cause, if you fall from the top of one of these walls, you probably won't survive. Overall, Mesa Rim is a no brainer for San Diego area climbers. It's pretty much amazing.

We brought in a small group of competitive youth climbers for lead practice last week and, upon all of them failing the lead belay instruction and test (I've heard and read a pretty fair amount about this), one of the staff who had just clocked out volunteered to stay for awhile on her own time, and lead belay our group. This person's name is Peggy and if you have the good fortune to have her assist you then you are in good hands. She helped us out for about two hours, many kudos to Peggy!Our only real negative for the day came in the form of our test for lead belaying. I didn't pick up on the name of the staff member who observed the test, but his method was to watch everything that was done, then point out all the mistakes that were made, suggest we take the Lead 102 class, and tell us to come back the following week to try the test again. His attitude was pretty much neutral, not exactly unfriendly, but came across as very unapproachable. He also mentioned several times how super dangerous climbing is, but as part of the test directed \u00a0the climber jump from the topmost part of the climb \u00a0(an overhanging 5.8 at the top of the arch), above the last clip, and take a 15 foot fall from the ceiling, as a test for the belayer. I understand why this might be a good test for the belayer, but a lead fall is a lead fall.
