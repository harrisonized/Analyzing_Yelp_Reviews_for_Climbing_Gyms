I joined at the start of Feb. after climbing for a year at (the much smaller, but also cheaper) Hangar 18, and I'm impressed. It is worth the $80/month membership.The bouldering walls have awesome variation in size and angle -- and ditto the routes, too. I'm progressing in strength and climbing grade largely because of the diversity of climbing offered. I don't use the toprope/lead walls, but they're as good as I've seen in LA County.The people are chill -- I've had fun just meeting and climbing with someone for a single session, several times. And even during peak busy hours, it feels like there's plenty of room to roam. I've read about people who have issues with the parking. I've come in the morning, midday, evening and late-night, on weekdays and weekends -- no doubt, the lot is often packed. But I've never spent more than 5 minutes looking for parking on the blocks surrounding Cliffs, either. Even when you have to pay for street parking, it's a crazy 50 cents for 2 hours. I don't really consider it a downside of climbing here, tbh. Plus there are lockers, showers, sauna, a system training room, yoga classes, weight room with squat rack and bench press...

I've been a touchstone member for about four months now and have really fallen in love with all the LA Touchstone gyms. My boyfriend and I recently got our belay certification with Touchstone and everything about the process was awesome! We were able to take a belay class without any kind of reservation and it's free of charge for members! ($35 for non-members). Our teacher, Sarah, was so helpful and made all the steps and check-points so easy to understand. A few days later we went back to Cliffs to take the belay test and we were given a temporary pass. One week later, we took the belay test again and got the permanent card! Cliffs is awesome because there is such good balance between the top rope/lead section and the bouldering section. I'm more of a novice climber and I am still able to find so many great problems to work on both with top rope and bouldering! Like all the other gyms, I really appreciate how often the route setters come in and update the problems! It happens often enough that I never have time to get bored! Aside from climbing, Cliffs really has amazing additional amenities. I use the very clean showers every time I go to the gym and I know it's random, but I love the smell of the soap they provide! I haven't taken the time to try it yet, but it's also great that there is a sauna to use after a hard day of climbing. Not to mention the different classes you can take, the cardio and weight machines and even a hidden bouldering wall just for practice!

The parking lot is pretty big, but it was full, even on a weekday. There's street parking, but it's all metered. When you enter, you need to check in on the iPads they have in front. It's not too bad. Basically, you're signing in saying you can't sue 'em if you get hurt. Fair enough, since you could possibly get hurt falling, but they do teach you how to fall properly, so you probably won't get hurt if you follow their instructions. We were given a group rate which was $5 off the normal rate. Pretty cool. They give you rock climbing shoes and a bag o' chalk when you pay up. Once we donned our super tight fitting rock climbing shoes (they're supposed to be super tight) we were given a really quick lesson on how to fall properly. We all had to prove we could fall properly. Unfortunately, those are the only tips we got. We were completely on our own with no tips on how to climb properly. A HUGE star off for that.Some of the kids had been there before and were given some very helpful climbing tips that are essential. The walls are high and there are no super easy climbs. Even the simplest climbs are challenging. The walls are high. If you fall from near the top you could really hurt yourself bumping your body against the \"rocks\" on your way down to the hard mat. Five more minutes of tips and helping the novices get started would have made a big difference.Also, it turns out when you pay you have access to other parts of the complex such as the gym, finger exercise machines, etc. We were told none of that. Another big fat star off for that. How hard is it to simply explain what's available to everyone?Some of the kids who were there before had someone who cared enough to give them a tour of the complex so they knew what else you could do besides climbing the walls. I had no idea I had access to other parts of the complex until we'd already left. Here's a tip from a novice. I don't recommend wearing shorts. My knees got a little skinned up climbing the walls.I did manage to make it to the top of one of the walls.

Since writing my previous review, Cliffs has updated their weight room and made it much more user friendly. Most of the issues with the old weight room were resolved (although there is still very little space in the way of cubbies for personal equipment). I'll briefly recap a few things that didn't change from my last review first:\"The weight room at \"Cliffs of Id\" might be small, but it's actually pretty good if you are into crossfit, powerlifting, or just general strength and conditioning. There is a squat rack and bench. There are all sorts of dumbells, as well as kettlebells up to 60lbs. There is one cable machine if you like doing auxiliary work on those. There are also treadmills and rowers. \u00a0The staff is friendly and gym clean. There are lots of yummy snacks, and unlike other gyms, I find most of them things I would actually enjoy (they have locally-made cold brew, among other things). There are tables with power outlets if you want to take a break. The bathrooms are spotless and have showers and saunas. Lockers are plentiful. Parking is hard to come by at night, but ok all day.\"Now, for the changes! Since writing my last review, the gym has added:-One plyometric box, which is great for box jumps or weighted box step ups. It can be set up as either 20\" or 24\".-Many, many new bumper plates, and one more barbell. There are now enough weights for three people to be deadlifing/squatting/benching at the same time with light to moderate weights, or two people at the same time with heavy-ish weights. That said, today, there were two of us deadlifting over 300lbs each, and there were not enough bumper plates to make that work unless we added in the smaller, plastic weights too. But that was really more of an anomaly; I think the weight situation is fine as it is.-A pull-up rack with enough space for 3 people to be comfortably doing pull-ups at the same time. Say goodbye to everyone using the squat rack for pull-ups!I would still like to see more cubbies to store personal stuff in the weight room (stuff that you are intending to use in your workout like belts, knee sleeves, and water bottles), but really, besides that, the upgraded room is pretty great.

I told her I was starting to exercise again, and she immediately invited me to her climbing gym, an invitation I'd laughed off several times over the last year. I joined her two nights ago at the Cliffs of Id, and am pleasantly surprised that my forearms are recovered enough to let me type this review.The plan was to go to a 7:15 yoga class and do some bouldering afterward (I count this as two workouts, and Mel informed me that she'd also had a very hard workout that morning--so fifteen a week is a conservative estimate). Since it was my first time in, I had to fill out a waiver on an iPad, but the process was easy enough, and Mel signed me in as her guest (I guess members get some guest passes). The people at the front desk, who also rented me climbing shoes ($4), were responsive and friendly.The gym was huge, with most of the space dedicated to climbing walls, with rooms upstairs for exercise classes and more classic gym equipment, machines and weights and all that. This upstairs area may not be the main point of the place, but must be a huge plus. If you don't have a gym membership, Cliffs of Id seems to offer the usual gym basics on top of the climbing walls.

(I commented that it had to stay open late for all the type-A professionals, and Mel said there were tons of freelancers, too. I am a sort of freelancer, and I can tell you that freelancers prefer to work out during the day, when even exercise seems more appealing than writing another scrap of a slow-going novel.)We started with yoga, a vinyasa flow class taught by a woman whose honeyed, languid voice has been stuck in my head since Wednesday night. I don't have a strong basis for comparison, but I thought it was a great class. I was mostly able to follow along, with my poor flexibility and beginner status, and Mel wasn't completely bored the whole time. I was more or less ready to go home afterward, but yoga was just the appetizer for a whole new world of pain.This was my first time climbing other than this one random and largely unsuccessful night at a now-closed gym in Connecticut in 2009, at which I didn't have a Mel to keep insisting I try this or that wall, and so mostly watched other people and hoped no one noticed me. I guess beginners are advised to start on the walls with ropes, but that seemed like a hassle, what with all the harnessing and the having to teach me to belay and be belayed, so we went right to bouldering. I have no upper body strength (or lower body strength), so this was definitely the bolder choice (writing puns on Yelp requires no muscle).The thing about climbing gyms is they look super fun and friendly, with colorful fake rocks that make you fantasize about monkey running up walls. Mel told me I would love climbing because it was like a puzzle, and I was like nice try but a puzzle is something I do with just my largest muscle, my brain. Climbing is closer to a bad dream in which you arrive at Willy Wonka's factory and every fucking thing tastes like a vegetable. I like vegetables fine, but I know they're for my health. These candy-colored holds are no game, but an enemy to be vanquished, and only by the mighty.The rocks are color-coded, indicating different paths up the walls of varying levels of difficulty. The levels start at 0 and top out at 10. Mel is at a 3, which kind of blows my mind, and I looked no further than 0. I tried out four of these 0 courses, and was able to finish two of them. The others involved feats of strength that nearly defied my imagination. I honestly tried my best, but shit was not happening.Even with all this failure, and a lot of down time watching Mel and two of her climbing friends (I guess people are social here), I became sore in ways that my body didn't recognize. At one point, I marveled at the way my forearms felt more like rubber than flesh. Climbing is supposed to build strength pretty quickly, and I believe it.I live moderately close to Cliffs of Id and would theoretically be open to joining, but only if this phase of shame-driven physical activity lasts more than a couple of months. I don't know that bouldering will become part of my life any time soon, but I do see the appeal, and this seems as good a place as any to develop a punishing hobby.", "date": "7/21/2017"}, {"review_id": "OHnTWBT59K7fpjs6h_yy8A", "user_id": "34VIYiEuySNP7rx4e0N10w", "user_name": "Jeff M.", "business_id": "RdxAwYiXLb3PQY4MJCGzXA", "stars": 5, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "This place is amazing.

When it was time to demonstrate belaying, he gave me absolutely no tension on the rope so I had to quickly try to belay rope that had so much slack it was touching the ground in front of me - meaning I had to pull pretty much down to my knees and ended up doing this super awkward thing to slide my hands and maintain contact with the rope. It made me look like I had no idea what I was doing and he stood there doing absolutely nothing other than stare at me blankly and wait for me to hurriedly gather up more rope than I would ever have to deal with if I were actually actively belaying someone.He did the same thing to my partner, so we both ended up just getting day passes even though once we were on the wall actually belaying each other we were totally fine, because we're not idiots and actually knew what we were doing.This guy has led shitty certification tests for friends of mine as well, and he's already gotten a couple complaints because of it. He was looking directly at a friend while she was undoing the ATC since she thought the test was done, and said \"falling\" and immediately threw his weight back even though it was clear she didn't know the test was still happening and he could have communicated to her that they weren't done yet.Next time I come in to toprope, I will turn right the hell around if he's working the test area because I am not dealing with that garbage again.

My boyfriend is a climber so we would take trips to Joshua Tree every once in a while and I'd also join him at his climbing gym in Long Beach every now and then. When I moved out to Culver City I decided to join a climbing gym because I wanted to get more into it! I've never had a membership at a climbing gym before, but I've been to a few and climbed with a day pass. This is a GREAT first gym to get a membership at. It's a fantastic gym in general. I've had a membership here since it opened in late December of 2015 and it's been so awesome. This place is HUGE and there are endless problems to work on. There's something for everyone here from beginners to the very experienced climbers.They also host classes in a room on the second story. I've been to the yoga classes and loved them. I think they also do TRX classes and a few other activities too. Right next to that room is a weight and cardio room. There's free weights, ellipticals and treadmills. And on top of that they also have a steam room. This place really has it all. It's a little pricey but I'm more than willing to pay to go to this gym. A membership is $75/month and a day pass is $20 (if you come before 3 p.m. the day pass is $15). The vibe is awesome, the employees and members are super welcoming and helpful, and it's a really nice facility. Parking is pretty tough. It's a small lot and it fills up really quickly. There's street parking around the area but on weeknights it's still pretty difficult to find a spot, so be prepared to hunt for a place to park your car.Right now they only have bouldering, but around summer 2016 they'll have top roping!

If you haven't done much belaying or have done a class somewhere else, it's a good idea to do their intro class. They have some specific questions they ask, I mixed up one thing and they gave me a temp pass, so I will take the test again next time I come back. They rent harnesses and belay devices, climbing shoes of course and chalk I think as well. Very nice and spacious with sauna and showers, classes every day of the week.

If you're scrolling down this page searching for reason to come to Cliffs of Id, let me tell you, there are many. With it's recent opening and amazing offers, there's really not much more you could ask for. Let me break it down for you.Service: There are people who are good at customer service, and then there are genuinely awesome people who are just as excited as you are to be there. Joe and Kimi were so helpful with all of my questions about the gym and were happy to help my friends with anything they needed. Joe gave really great tips to a friend of mine who needed new shoes, and gave a really thorough breakdown of their membership program for the others! By far one of the best and most honest customer service I've gotten.Space: Not only are the walls set up in beautiful shapes, but they're really fun to climb! They offer so many different levels on each wall so there's no getting bored in there. They're not even done building the place - can you imagine how amazing it's going to be? Despite their \"in progress\" construction, they manage to keep the place clean, functional, and comfortable. They offer you a sauna and shower in their bathrooms for you to clean off. Talk about being pampered!Parking:This ones a little tricky, but I've always managed to grab either street parking or a spot inside. The gym is growing to be popular so parking towards the evening gets filled up. But if you drive around, you're bound to find a place to leave your car.I used to have to drive 30 minutes to get to LAB downtown, but this gym is an awesome and more convenient replacement. I'm so glad I met Joe and Kimi - they really bring that inviting atmosphere to Cliffs of Id. Thanks for making my friends and I feel so welcome!

From a safety perspective I was mildly worried that they use static ropes for the fixed rope ropes without mentioning that to climbers that were about to use their walls. This shouldn't be a big problem that static ropes are used, but falls on static rope, even on top rope could end up pretty rough if some slack is out.

I had never ever bouldered before then, but I thought it was a fun experience. In summer 2015, I learned that Cliffs of Id was opening a few miles away from my home, and I eagerly awaited its opening so I could put my gym membership money toward a place that I actually enjoyed going to since I can be the most sedentary and lazy person I know. I've been a member of COI since January 2016 and it's been exciting to see the gym attract more and more people while taking root in the community. Now that the rope walls are finally open, you can now practice the ultimate trust fall with your belay partner. While this relatively huge climbing gym attracts a lot of people, there's still enough room to move around, and street parking can still be found if you look hard enough. Of all the Touchstone gyms in LA, this is probably the best one in terms of general size, both the bouldering and roped areas, and the sheer size of its own private parking lot. Routes here seemed to be graded super soft during the first few months after opening, but I think the grading may have been stepped up slightly since. Regardless, it makes it more fun for beginners when they can actually send problems. Routes are changed out anywhere from 3-6 weeks, so you have plenty of time to project problems if you're a regular, or if you're just flashing everything, there always seems to be something new to try. Monthly membership is $77, which isn't bad if you come to the gym at least 4x in one month to recoup the costs of a day pass. You also get 1 free guest pass per month to use for a friend and on every 4th Friday, you get a bonus guest pass to lure more of your friends into the gym. The gym also has yoga and other fitness classes, a weight room with machines, and really clean locker rooms with showers and a sauna.All in all, I'm super happy to have a place that I look forward to going to 3x a week instead of spending another night in glued to Netflix.
