I am a member here solely due to the fact that they meet the basics for a rock climbing gym. they have bouldering and some sort of ballet.1st big issue they're size... much \u00a0much smaller than most the gyms within 30 miles \u00a0of the area. To their defense, santa monica is very expensive and they do a lot with the room they have but none the less it's small and very expensive.2nd issue their buddy system. Every other gym i've been to lets you bring one buddy per month for free with a membership. this place lets you bring one person for free, but it must be their first time. From a business standpoint, I don't understand this, most people do not join a gym after there first time. it usually takes a few times so why not let them bring the same friend two months in a row. Thats how i decided to sign up and I've had two friends get memberships at another gym i went to after bringing them a few times.3rd HUGE issue is the belay system. Both the gyms i've been to only had auto belay and I've never used a buddy belay system. So coming here they make you past a test and give you a prep piece of paper that looks like its from the 90s. They would not even let me use my phone to watch a youtube video on how to do it \"for insurance issues.\" But they did suggest i purchase a $45 class that would show me how to tie a rope and how to brake a buddy. $45 after i just signed up for a membership for something that was learned off of youtube in less than 8 min.Basically if you're equally as far from this place as the other gyms, go to the other ones, much better quality gyms and cheaper.

I did not utilize the toproping/leading section of the gym. Also, I've been a member of a couple of different gyms (all while in Northern CA) and wanted to give this gym a try to see if I could make it my home gym as it's on the way between my work and apartment.Unfortunately, despite the amazing location, I don't see myself coming to this gym on a regular basis. Parking is actually not as bad as some folks make it sound, I was able to find parking within a block of the place and, since I was coming in to work out, walking a block was not an issue. The front desk staff was extremely welcoming and friendly during my experience and they did a great job showing off the gym. The bathroom/locker rooms are all new and spotless.The bouldering area is tiny. It wasn't over populated the day that I went but I can see how it could get cramped easily. The routes aren't that great either. Actually, that's the main reason why I'm giving this place such a low rating. Not to say I'm that great of a climber but I do have experience climbing both indoor and outdoor and I found these routes really confusing and disconnected. Part of it is the fact that they'll have same colored routes intersecting or adjacent and the other part is that the routes themselves have no continuity. Also, a good section of the wall was just unlabeled. Not the biggest issue for me but I noticed it steered a good majority of the crowd to one section, making it even more crowded. Overall, great location, chill staff, decent space for a smaller gym but really underwhelming and disappointing in terms of routes.

I've been to a few climbing gyms across the U.S. and this gym by far has routes that are pretty outstanding, not to mention challenging and for the most part rated correctly. On occasion, there were a couple routes that made me sit back and scratch my head in puzzlement but eventually if there was a will there was a way. My god, countless hours staring at the different colored routes - hating and loving them at the same time. I used to break a sweat on the pink routes but after putting in time over the course of many months I made it all the way to greens and blues!The top ropes here are decent too, but I recall liking the top ropes at Boulderdash in Thousand Oaks slightly better. Anyway, I took the Fight Gravity series and the instructors are great! They even have kid classes for the little ones.They also have a small area for weights and cardio.

I've only been climbing for about 6 months and try to go at least twice a week, so my review is given through the eyes of a newbie trying to transform into a legit climber.Few quick notes: 1. I know my review below may sound critical, but I think due to the fact that climbing CAN be a very dangerous activity, it's ESPECIALLY pertinent to be proactive about everyone's safety.2. Climbers I've met here are some of the most supportive and friendly people I've met. It will probably be really easy for a newbie to come in and make friends/climbing partners.3. Staff members are generally friendly - ask them questions if you aren't sure about something.4. All the roped routes seem very bouldery... but that's probably to make up for the short wall. Other gyms with tall walls I've been to have settings that are mellow until you get to the 4th/5th clip (safe to fall at that point).5. Dirty carpet and feet smell? That seems unavoidable at any climbing gym. I just try to wipe my feet before leaving and have a separate pair of flip flops for my gym days. #1 annoying + dangerous thing about this gym:- Rockreation has kids' classes couple days out of the week... which coincide with the time when people are getting out of work and start coming into the gym (hectic!). As a fee paying customer, I don't like how climbers have to wait around for the kids' warm-ups and give up the main space so they can conduct their class. I don't remember agreeing to this inconvenience when I signed up. It's a SMALL space to begin with, and it's really awful because a lot of the kids don't know how to behave in a climbing gym. - I've had TOO MANY instances where kids (early teens - are they still kids?) bumped into me while I was belaying or they would trip over my rope. I even actually had a kid throw a shoe and hit me while I was belaying my partner as he was climbing the arch. What makes me angry is that some of the staff seem so lackadaisical about this type of unruliness. UNACCEPTABLE. I understand that they are kids, but they are under the gym's supervision... SO SUPERVISE THEM! Just a quick note to parents who bring in their young children into the gym: PLEASE DON'T LET THEM RUN AROUND WHILE YOU ARE CLIMBING. It is DANGEROUS. Supervised or not, they shouldn't be roaming around the gym where they can be a danger to climbers. I've actually seen a toddler in a diaper roam around willy nilly as the parents were climbing... and the kid ran into the belayer's arms... \u00a0O_O ... and the staff didn't say anything to them. GENERAL/UNIVERSAL note for everyone (important points + etiquette I've learned/observed): - DON'T step on someone else's rope. Especially when it's being used!- DON'T traverse or climb underneath a climber (for rope/boulder/auto belay!)- DON'T traverse too high (I actually recently saw a guy who fell off from almost at the top of the wall and smacked his head and got carried out by EMT). Even if you are a great climber, you never know if you'll slip off. Be considerate of the people you may hit if you fall. - DON'T wear your harness in the bouldering area. Do you really want to take the chance of falling weirdly on your harness/gear/carabiner?- LISTEN UP for people announcing \"LOWERING\" - you may have a climber being lowered over your head. Actually, don't stand around at points where climbers are going to be lowered, period. Always be aware of your surroundings!! - DON'T give a ton of unnecessary slack during lead climbing even if you're belaying a human monkey. I'm no expert, but if someone falls on their 2nd or 3rd clip and there's a ton of slack out.... you get my point (hopefully).", "date": "10/16/2015"}, {"review_id": "-5IN0onL7p21Hg-tLxgRxg", "user_id": "pZh1obL9FVg6jjlNX6G5lw", "user_name": "John V.", "business_id": "Ky4_MzwoLcVhBpuWcJsPwA", "stars": 4, "useful": 5, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Over the past 8 years I've been a member of 3 different climbing gyms.

There are so many walls for you to climb on and they're all nicely labeled with the level of difficulty. As a novice, I climbed a 5.1 with little difficulty. They even have walls for bouldering - it's harder than it looks because of the steepness of the incline, but you can get some pretty awesome photos of you on rocks! See photo taken here as an example. I make it look easy, but I let go immediately after this photo was snapped.Parking: One thing that made me frustrated about coming here was the parking situation. There's a lot outside of the facility, but most of the spots are \"reserved\" for the other tenants in the building, but I was unsure whether these reserved spots were still supposed to be reserved even after normal business hours. So, after deciding that I did not want to risk getting towed, I had to park on the street and climb the high wall and shrubs that separated the street from the parking lot.All in all, I loved my experience here. As a novice who's pretty scared of heights, the thrill of climbing up high and coming down is so much fun. Though you can get tired pretty quickly. I can't wait to come back.Tip: If you plan to climb for an hour and this is your first time here, you should allocate about an extra 30 minutes to the time you spend here because of the belaying test.

I feel like my college gym smelt worse. The staff here is super friendly. I don't think that people should expect the staff to try to be everyone's best friends. They do their jobs.

I learned how to belay, the basics of climbing and got a week of unlimited climbing. From there I opted to enroll in FG2 and 3, which gives a total of 1 month unlimited climbing, and also gives more advanced instruction and technique classes. The instructors are great. They're passionate and personable too. They teach the fundamentals, giving you a good foundation to build your climbing career. Remember to climb with your skeleton! You'll learn it ;)If you're just starting out, I highly recommend the FG series. Not only will it get you hooked, it will also accelerate your learning curve. Literally by the end of FG3 (after 2weeks climbing), I sent my first V2 bouldering problem (sent, meaning I finished it), which is not too shabby I think. The climbersThe best thing about rock climbing is that most climbers are really friendly and social. People are especially communal in the bouldering area. Friends and strangers alike love to work on problems together.In fact, a friend I made while bouldering recently took me on my first trip outdoors to climb at Echo Cliffs. It was an absolutely transcendant experience and was totally made possible by the cool people at Rockreation!The facilitiesThe gym is on the small side. Walls aren't too tall. And routes can sometimes feel limited. I boulder mostly. The problems in the boulder area are adequate. Fellow climbers have told me the bouldering problems, when compared to other gyms, tend to be reachy or strengthy. Routes get reset more regularly than other gyms I've been to which is nice. Keeps me challenged. But I climb 3-4x a week so I could see some hardcore gymgoers getting \"bored.\" but at that point you should be getting outside anyway!

Also if you want to belay anyone or try top roping, you would have to take their lesson, which is $45.

I would say that rockreation is great for top roping as they have a lot more routes than Hangar 18. \u00a0However, their bouldering is pretty limited to a small section, and their membership is $45 a month (or maybe even more?), and I dont think there are student discounts. Top roping is definitely a lot more fun than bouldering (personally), but top rope belaying is a bit more difficult than using a GriGri, which you need to learn before you can do anything at rockcreation. They even test you before they let you start climbing. \u00a0So at least you know you're in safe hands if you do top rope?Anyway, this is probably the only climbing gym close enough for me to go to on a regular basis, and despite the cost it is a lot of fun and can be really addicting. there are probably better and bigger gyms around, but none are within driving distance. and i have close to no upper body strength so i've definitely developed more forearm muscles than i had a month ago... don't know how handy that will ever come in life... the staff is friendly and rock climbers in general are great people to be around. so give it a try!

When possible, I prefer to contact managers directly about poor service. However, when I asked for contact information of a manager, I was given a scrap piece of paper with a phone number on it (no name, no e-mail), and I looked it up... he gave me the gym's number. So, Yelp review it is.First, let me preface by saying that I have been climbing for over ten years. I have done bouldering, top rope climbing, and lead climbing at gyms in San Diego (Solid Rock and Vertical Hold!). I had a monthly membership at Solid Rock in San Marcos. I then moved to Orange, tried an indoor gym, found it too difficult to climb due to financial restrictions, and so I put a hold on climbing for a few years. Now that I have moved up to LA, I was so excited to see that there was a gym near me. I hoped that I could get back into the swing of things. So, I checked out Rockreation's website. First, $26 for a day pass/gear is pretty darn expensive. I also checked out their yearly rates (since I was thinking about another membership) and found out it would be $699 for an annual membership. Wow! Still really expensive! But, this gym was the closest, so I went for it.First, we walk in and find an employee checking people in. He seems friendly, and I let him know that we are new to the gym but not to climbing. He pulls out an ATC belay device and asks if I'm familiar. I say that I've used it before, but would like a refresher. The mood changes. He pulls out a long checklist of things that he tells us we will be \"tested on\" to see if we can top rope climb. If we do not pass, we can only boulder... and they won't teach us or review anything with us before the test. The test includes figure eight knots, \"belay on,\" and other basics. I let him know that I have used figure eight knots in the past, but that my last gym used grigri clips, so I would love if we could get a refresher.Well, that changes things. I am allowed to take the test, but my two friends will not be able to because they have never used figure eight knots (but have belayed and climbed extensively). He also will not show us what to do unless it takes less than \"two minutes\" because they're busy and short-staffed. Um, what? I have never, ever been at a gym where I was refused a belay lesson. Gyms are all about safety, but they also want people to be able to climb and pay them money! One of my friends was also pitched a belay class that cost $99 (includes month's membership and gear). I'm sorry... a belay class that costs $99 dollars? For six hours of training? Yes, it includes a month's membership. But what if I only need six minutes of quick refresher training, not SIX HOURS? And if you don't take this $99 class, you can't top rope climb. This is a blatant rip-off and poor gym service.By the way, by comparison, the local gym in SD cost $9 for a belay training. But whatever, okay, I figured I would try and practice for their test, take it, and get to climbing. I went over and practiced my knots, and asked some patrons to show me and make sure I was right. I did remember correctly, so I thought I was good to go. The only thing I didn't remember how to use was the ATC, and I figured they could at least show me that.So, my friend and I went back to the desk to begin our test. The original staff member was very busy texting on his phone (really busy, right?), so a second staff member said he would help. I explained that I had several years of climbing experience, but was a bit rusty, and so I would appreciate it if he could explain the ATC. He looked suspicious that I had ever climbed before, and he showed it to us very quickly, without explanation, as if he was giving us a cheat. I then showed him I could tie a figure eight knot as a climber, and my friend asked again if he could explain the ATC (because he had never used it). He did in about five seconds, and my friend put on the ATC correctly. The staff member then began to ask us in a patronizing tone if we could examine each other for safety issues. I pointed one out, growing frustrated--if there are any, just show us and move along!He then started to quiz me about harnesses (including kinds I was not wearing), and I decided I did not want to spend a night being patronized instead of climbing. I gave up and asked for a refund. Basically, I fail to understand how they did not have time for a five minute belay lesson, but did have time for a 10-15 minute test where the potential clients are made to feel like fools. I wanted this to be my regular place. I wanted to give them more than a $1,000/year in membership fees. But, I have never been made to feel less welcome or as incompetent as I was made to feel here. Add that to the numerous unsupervised and often dangerous climbing errors I saw around the room, and you have the many reasons why this is the worst gym I have ever been to.

I got a deal via Groupon for $35 that got me a belaying lesson (2 hours) and 2 wks of unlimited climbing. You must reserve your spot for the belaying class, which I believe happens on Saturdays (noon-2pm) and Tuesday nights from (7-9pm.) I was in a class with a group of about 10 other people. Some of us were beginners and some of us had climbing experience before. You DO NOT need any experience of climbing whatsoever to take this class. Our instructors were Dennis and Jeremy. I've read some bad reviews of the staff/instructors, but my experience was pleasant. Both the front desk and our instructors were super helpful and friendly. In the belaying class, you learn everything from putting on your harness correctly, learning how to tie a perfect \"8\" knot, to being a responsible belayer. From there, you and your partner switch off climbing and practice communicating the climbing lingo, such as \"On belay/Belay on,\" \"Climbing/Climb on,\" \"Tension/Tension on, and \"Lowering/Lower on.\" This portion of the class takes a little over an hour.The remaining time, Jeremy took us over to the bouldering section of the room. This area is basically a free climb where you climb without any support, but there are crash pads you can use. He tells you the benefits of climbing this area (great body workout/more technique minded/group activity) and demonstrates how to climb the wall...which he does so freaking effortlessly. (I tried attempting this bouldering area with my toosh on the floor, which is how you're supposed to start, and I couldn't get myself up from the floor. Me = weakling.) This area was definitely more crowded than the regular rock walls, but I liked the idea of free climbing and something more challenging. There are sections to the bouldering wall that are easier than others. All in all, I was very pleased with my purchase and hope to come back soon. Toward the end of class, Jeremy went over the other classes we can sign up for and to come back quick to take the belaying test. (I guess every climber needs to pass this test?) Side notes:-The parking lot is limited for Rockreation members. However, there's PLENTY of street parking.-With the belaying class, shoes were provided.-One thing I wish the instructors would have gone over is the whole \"chalk\" thing. I assumed chalk helps with a climber's grip, but we were never told anything about it. Plus, I don't think they even have a \"chalk station\" for climbers. I saw most people bring their own bags of chalk.-The place doesn't smell all that bad, really. Some people have said it smells like a gym, but I only smelled it when we were sitting down.

Couple of them are overweight and out of shape, while the others know very little if anything about climbing and gear. (probably a big reason behind the problems here.) Their costs are outrageous, and their benefits are small. Here is a quick rundown:-$100 \"startup\" fee to begin a monthly membership-If you stop your membership at any time you need to pay the $100 again to restart (so you can't make this a \"winter only\" climbing spot..)-NOTE: You could take 2 months off, but you still have to pay a \"maintenance fee\" just to keep your account active.. -If you want to buy just a 1 month pass it's $100 (for ONE month)-They do NOT offer \"punch cards\" or other passes-They do NOT offer lead ropes for you to climb on, you have to bring your own (OMG!)-They do NOT offer guest passes (there is one specific day a month when you can bring a guest, and it usually falls on an odd day for climbing, like a Friday..)-I've been there 3 times in 3 years and they have lost my records every time, so I've had to re-take my belay test each time I've been there.-List goes on. You name it, it probably costs $100I highly suggest going down the 405 to Hangar 18 in Hawthorne where it's $99 for THREE MONTHS. You can also try \"The Arc\" in Arcadia which is $190 for SIX MONTHS (and they offer punch cards.) Both places have a staff which is active in climbing and are far better than the staff at Rockreation. Both places offer lead ropes for use, and both places offer cheap (i.e. usually free) belay lessons, etc.If you are serious about climbing you probably aren't rich, so I'd recommend you save your money and go somewhere else...
