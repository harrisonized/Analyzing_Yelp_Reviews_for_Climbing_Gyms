Unfortunately, sometimes it takes a negative experience to make someone actually come on Yelp and write a review. My daughter first climbed at Boulderdash in Westlake when she was in first grade, which was six years ago. She took a class through park and rec and loved it. Her instructors were great; it was a positive experience. Six months ago, my daughter started climbing again, after six years off. She started with a couple classes a week. Three months ago, she became a member. With her membership, she gets unlimited access to the gym and yoga classes. There was an initiation fee, but it felt reasonable to me. The terms of the membership were explained to me well. Her membership included a belay class, which they allowed me to take since she was not quite old enough to belay. Alex, the instructor of the classes she was taking told me about a teen climbing group and invited my daughter to join. She began going to teen climbing a few days a week. She has loved it. She could climb/belay (she took the class after her birthday so she could join the group) for two hours any week day. Alex is so great and really helped my daughter learn her new sport. Sometimes she was the only one to attend and sometimes there were several other kids. Regardless, he spent the time with her, guiding her in the sport. Suddenly today, Alex alerted us that the teen climbing group has been discontinued AND that he is no longer going to be at the gym. I believe canceling the class is a big mistake for the Boulderdash management. This class was a wonderful outlet for my daughter and several other young people. I am so disappointed and so is my daughter. I have not decided exactly what to do yet, but unfortunately, there isn't much option to go anywhere else. There's nothing else in town. I sincerely hope this is not a permanent change. These young climbers and their friends are Boulderdash's potential long-term clientele.", "date": "6/26/2018"}, {"review_id": "rJ0y0NHo74iTXJKad6Ov1Q", "user_id": "3SgArp6Mqu4DGwvxGCdSog", "user_name": "Susan C.", "business_id": "PDbuxryXvx3usOLVNMOF0Q", "stars": 3, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "The only bouldering/climbing place in Ventura county so you're stuck with this place no matter what. The Westlake gym is small and the bouldering walls are shorter than every other single place I've been to but I don't think there's much they can do given the size of the place and the top rope section. The bouldering section has pads you can drag around for extra fall protection but the ground is semi-squishy and the walls aren't tall enough to do any major damage. The owner (?) with the long hair is sometimes very blunt and can come off as rude but it's nothing too bad. During the weekend afternoons and weekday evenings it is super crowded which is only made worse with the lack of space they have. Weekends are filled with little kids running around and screaming.

However. The employee Matt (long curly grey hair, older, skinny, grumpy looking guy) has terrible attitude to customers! We were late for a few minutes for a rock climbing class where there were just me, my husband, one other guy, and the coach. As soon as we got in, we felt really bad and apologized, but he started yelling at us saying \"you guys were really late. Don't do this!\" He wasn't even looking at us when he was yelling. Later on, at the end of the class, I tried to talk to him and said I didn't really appreciate his attitude and the way he treated his customers didn't feel right. I asked him if he could please be nicer next time, especially we apologized for being late at the beginning.\" Without feeling bad at all, he still wouldn't make eye contact with us, and then started being extremely defensive. He said \"I didn't give you an attitude. Why are you asking me to be nicer? Was I not clear when I explained myself?\" I think Matt's attitude will continue to cause problems.

As in most of life, when you treat someone with respect and offer understanding, you will generally receive the same in return. A few things to consider based on my experiences:#1, Safety is their number one concern. Lives are on the line.You will be belay tested, both for top-roping, and for sport climbing. If you mess up, you will fail the test -- there is no leniency and rightfully so. It's not a game. It's a sport. And a very dangerous sport. The good news is, the belay test is free. The other good news is that if you do it right, your climbing experience can be very safe.If you're leading, you will likely be watched like a hawk and called out for bad clipping (skipped, z) or general dangerous behavior (foot behind the rope, etc.) Lazy belaying is not allowed -- read as: sitting down, or anything other than standing and paying attention. You need to be able to tie a figure-8 knot if you're over a certain age; 13, maybe? I'm not sure what age it is. I'm significantly over that age, so I had to learn.#2, This is a business. They're here to make money.I was reading a couple of reviews down below that sparked me to post this. Someone was complaining about being late to a scheduled class and having an issue with one of the staff. Hmmm. What about the other people in the class? Are they supposed to sit around and wait for you? What about the instructor? Is he supposed to stay longer to accommodate you because you were late? Do you expect the owners to pay the staff to stay longer to accommodate you? If they let you into the class, are you going to complain that you didn't get the full class because YOU WERE LATE TO A SCHEDULED CLASS?All I can say is that in most of life, if you're going to be late, call and explain the situation; perhaps they can find another way to help. Just spitballing here, but if 6:30 was going to be so tough (and it sounds like you knew you were going to be late based on your comments, \u00a0\"630 is not an easy time for everyone to make especially if you have kids and need to commute to work and back,\") perhaps you could hire one of the employees to teach you at a time when you could be there? I don't really know, and neither do you, because you didn't call before your scheduled appointed time.Small life-based rant: I'm sorry if you don't understand that other people's time is valuable, but you probably should learn that. A tough lesson for many to realize is that the world does not stop when you mess up. Question --- If you're in the #2 lane and about to miss your freeway exit with a busy freeway around you, do you A), bully your way across the freeway so you can make the exit, or B), accept that you messed up, and get off at the next exit? I'd wager you both are A). For me, personally, Matt has gone out of his way to help with anything that has been wrong or weird pertaining to my Boulderdash experience. Of course, I always offer respect and understanding, as with all employees, and people, really, and get the same in return. #3, It's nice that they change the routes frequently. #4, EVERYONE is friendly. If you go by yourself, you can almost always find someone there who will trade belays. \u00a0#5, While they do not have showers, there is a locker room (with locking door) where you can change.#6, SO BRIGHT!

It's a hidden climbing gym in TO! Even with the GPS on it was fun to find, from the road we were on we only saw signage for \"Spirtual Center\" but we had our hunch from how tall the building was from the outside. Make sure you go to Suite A, at first we found Suite B. Which is okay because walking across the courtyard we got to see the huge fountain. I'm diverging a bit here but if you must check it out, it's the size of a large swimming pool with a swan in it! Not going to lie, was slightly disappointed when I first saw the bouldering area. \u00a0The bouldering area is condensed and doesn't go up very high. This is good if you're afraid of heights or falling, in a way it encourages climbers to do their top rope sections. The entire floors is spongy, but there are a couple crash pads to drag around to further cushion any falls. The routes were mixed, with many challenging routes though since all the walls have an incline to them. The way the routes are set up stresses the importance of technique and planning moves ahead of time. Since I only bouldered I can't comment on top rope routes. A kid's birthday party was having a blast on the routes though, their exuberance and natural skill really made me old. The instructors seemed really great, they had the kids stretching, doing push-ups and some core work outs before climbing. \u00a0Really nice facility over all:Locker room to store your stuff so ins't all over the placeClean restroomsSells drinks to rehydrateLarge windows to provide natural lightingFree weights and medicine ball Gymnast ringsClimbing rope They are opening up a second Boulderdash soon in Chatsworth, so next time I'm on this side of the valley hopefully I can check it out.

There was a birthday party but the kids seemed to be well-behaved and not running under climbers. It's nice to have a variety of shorter and taller top rope walls. The belay test was easy- the staff will have you tie in as a climber, climb up a short wall, take a fall and then belay using an ATC and prove you never take your brake hand off the rope. I think it's ridiculous grigris are not allowed in the gym whatsoever. It seems more dangerous to have the lead ropes on the wall next to the lead climbing area for anyone to use rather than checking them out at the front desk.This gym seems great for children's birthday parties or drop-ins.

Probably outdoors a lot more. Unfortunately for those who love fresh air and real rock, Boulderdash offers a lot of competition for the real thing. Yes, there are those days where the California sun is shining and the air is cool that I decide to skip out on Stoney Point and head to Boulderdash instead. Why?Density of quality routes.Boulderdash has great variety of bouldering problems and sport climbing routes. The ability to hop off a juggy roof and start climbing a balancey face 30 second later just can't be recreated outdoors (unless you're hanging out in Squamish). I don't toprope there as much as I boulder, so my opinions are likely skewed and in favor of the short walls (though I've seen some quality TR routes there as well.)The route setting is great and frequent. Their setters reset almost all of the routes on one of the three main bouldering areas every few weeks, which gives climbers just enough time to send everything before it's all replaced. Their setting seems to get better every time they put up new routes, with nothing seeming overly contrived or boring. Even their \"easy (V0- to V1) routes are very fun, at times even challenging for the grade.The place is clean every time I go there, with chalk brushes scattered here and there giving evidence of recently cleaned holds. The unisex changing room is a nice touch (Ladies, avert your eyes) and the bathrooms were remodeled just a few weeks ago. Disgusting holds are no bueno. Nothing like scraping your elbow on a hold and going home with a staph infection. That won't happen here.What really sets Boulderdash apart is the incredibly friendly atmosphere. 9 out of 10 times you ask for help with a route someone is more than willing to offer it. Whether its new climbers asking a regular for advice on which routes to try, or strangers working a newly added route together, everyone is just friendly. The clientele is nice, talented, and (mostly) humble. Spray might be a bit of a problem here, but what can I say, I'm guilty of giving some unwanted beta too.The music. Oh, the music. I can ALWAYS count on hearing Jackson 5 and at least 3 or 4 Tool songs every time I go there. Come to think of it, the playlist seems like it hasn't changed much in the three odd years I've been coming here. But hey, a lot of it's good sending music.Prices are a little steep if you plan on coming a lot and don't have a membership - but since when are climbers the financially responsible type? If you plan on coming more than 3-4 times a month, a membership is the way to go. Occasional climbers might want to try their 10-day punch cards (something like 12 bucks a climb.) The staff is very accommodating and encouraging, and some of the younger guys will come climb with you.My only gripe about this place is more of a double edged sword than a complaint. Members are allowed to bring a guest in for free once a month, BUT as of January 1, they have to be a brand new guest, meaning they have never climbed there before. So much for taking my dirt poor climbing partners to the gym with me, but now I've got an excuse to take a dozen people climbing for their first time this year.Boulderdash's clean, friendly environment and quality route setting put it a cut above other indoor rock climbing gyms in the area.Oh, and neophytes - please take the staffs advice and rent shoes.

You don't want to show your fruit basket to all the ladies while you're climbing. This place is covered with climbing walls and is the real deal with gear for rent and walls for beginners and pros alike. When I suggested we go down to the Pantages (yelp.com/biz/pantages-th\u2026) to see Wicked (yelp.com/biz/wicked-the-\u2026) my wife counter-suggested that we go rock climbing instead. Surprised by her \"off the wall\" idea, I found Boulderdash on the web, gave them a call, and they had room for us in their Friday night class. We took a two hour lesson and by the end we were scampering up with no problem. They teach you how to tie a figure 8 knot that will pretty much be the only thing keeping you from falling to your death if you let go. So you better know how to tie it well! They also teach you how to belay someone and how to do multiple gear checks. Finally, you do a few practice climbs and safety fake falls so you get used to everything. Then you just climb. There's something about climbing that's very basic and clears your mind while filling your body full of adrenaline. You reach the top, look down, satisfied with what you have accomplished, and then slowly float back down. The class was $40 each and they even said we could stay longer to climb if we wanted to. Unfortunately the babysitter was sucking up our money and we had to return to reality. Now that we took the class, if we want to climb anytime it will only cost us $15 each plus $6 to rent the gear. Ideally we would go with our kids so we don't have to pay for a babysitter. While we were there, we saw some 4 and 5 year-olds climbing the walls with no fear at all. The place had a locker room, bathrooms, and a classroom. Everything was very clean and professional. The instructor was a young guy who had been climbing his whole life. He was easy to understand and very patient with us climbing noobs. Next time, I think we'll grab some Thai food at Thai Westlake nearby (yelp.com/biz/thai-westla\u2026) before we climb .
