LA.B facilities are not as advanced as So Cal Touchstone's other bouldering gyms (Hollywood Boulders and Cliffs of Id) as they don't have designated training rooms, top rope area, saunas, and more. \u00a0However, the place is intimate and has the friendliest people!They've recently given their yoga room upstairs a little makeover as well! \u00a0This room is used for classes such as TRX training, Acro-Yoga, Thai and Fly (Thai massage), Muy Thai and Yoga Anusara. \u00a0It's enclosed so people aren't as distracted. \u00a0The upstairs workout area, which has a Stair Master, two row machines, ellipticals, and treadmills occasionally serves as a workout area for classes such as Kettle Bell training, Sweat and Shred, and Buns and Guns, and more. \u00a0Anyone new to bouldering who is serious about improving and making this a regular activity should consider the bouldering technique classes that LA.B offers as well. \u00a0Most classes and fitness classes are free (or at a small fee) for members. \u00a0Guests of the gym pay a fee to attend the classes.Day pass prices for bouldering:-$25 for weekdays after 3pm, and weekends. \u00a0-$20 for weekdays before 3pm, except holidays-$20 for kids under 12-$4 for shoe rentals-$1 for chalkThere are packages that they offer as well, like a 10-pack or special summer packs, so call ahead to find out!", "date": "12/3/2018"}, {"review_id": "CKwEsuar4LSLn_-mwd0gMw", "user_id": "MEyP4th9ckkz7KtxaRP2Ww", "user_name": "Justin F.", "business_id": "c_kY-WNaL2OGpDryJQ5aHQ", "stars": 5, "useful": 7, "funny": 5, "cool": 9, "text": "Think you've got what it takes to conquer the routes because you go to the gym regularly and are in decent shape? Well put that pride away and think again! I didn't realize it initially since it was my first time bouldering, but I soon accepted that my strength was not going to be a trump card for routes beyond V3. You have to practice and master good technique and finesse to finish the harder routes. Pace yourself and take breaks because you will tire yourself out quickly in less than 2 hours if you attempt climb after climb. This facility has something for people of all skill levels and interests. Not only are there bootcamp and yoga classes, they also have a strength training area complete with weights. Though they do not have roped climbing, they do have about 200 bouldering routes. These routes are all color coordinated with grips of all sizes and shapes. The floor is well-padded so falls for beginners like myself did not seem so bad. You should consider practicing proper landing/falling techniques that are taught in the introductory class that I did not have a chance to take. Pricing has naturally gone up over the years. It is now $25 for weekdays after 3pm and weekends and $20 for weekdays before 3pm. Members are able to bring a friend for free through a guest pass on the 4th Friday of every month. Parking is probably the only sore spot. When you give up on looking for parking on the small lot shared with the shooting range next door, you'll find a space somewhere eventually on the street.

Anything else would require more technique. They offer a small area with weights to workout on the bottom floor and cardio machines on the second floor. Everything is clean and well kept. I feel that the pricing is a bit high but it is totally worth it. Lots of different areas for you to climb and you could spend a whole day here assuming you have the stamina and your hands are not raw after the first hour. Remember to chalk up and use your legs when to climb otherwise you will skin your hands like me... For parking, they offer a couple spaces in the back shared by LA Gun Club.

Either way, LA Boulders is definitely worth checking out if you've been meaning to cross bouldering off your bucket list or just looking to kill a few hours with some good ol' exercise.I had the opportunity to visit this plastic playground thanks to a friend with a guest pass, which is typically available to existing members on the fourth Friday of every month. \u00a0Even with the extra crowds taking advantage of the fourth Friday free promotion, it wasn't too difficult to stake out a spot. \u00a0The gym is large, well padded, and accessible to people of all skill levels, and there are small cardio and strength training areas if you're sticking to a more traditional fitness routine. The bouldering routes are rated V0 to V12+ and are color-coded for simplicity. \u00a0 As a bouldering newbie, I was proud of myself for successfully navigating several V2 routes. \u00a0But, I quickly became aware of the skill and thought required to make it up some of the more difficult routes, especially the ones with inverted inclines or tiny grips. If you don't have a membership, there are several options for visitors. \u00a0The day pass costs $25 (weekends and weekdays after 3PM) or $20 (weekdays before 3PM) and gives you access to a \"free\" (i.e. included in the price) intro to bouldering class. \u00a0If you don't have an experienced friend to guide you, then it's probably worthwhile to take the class since proper falling techniques are important when you accidentally slip or lose your grip. \u00a0It's an additional $4 to rent bouldering shoes and $1 for a chalk bag to keep your hands dry. \u00a0You can get your money's worth if you spend a good chunk of time, but keep in mind that your arms will get tired after a few hours of intermittently scrambling up the walls. \u00a0Store your belongings in the locker room (upstairs) or one of the cubbies adjacent to the main area.While there are several parking spaces reserved for LAB directly in front of the building, you'll likely have to find street parking, which may or may not be difficult on the day and time you find yourself here. \u00a0It might seem sketchy if you're unfamiliar with this area of DTLA, but the area is rapidly gentrifying (for better or for worse).I probably won't be testing my newfound bouldering skills outside anytime soon, but I'd definitely come back to LA Boulders soon!", "date": "2/17/2018"}, {"review_id": "s-gwSeD2xvo7VlSnudFJxg", "user_id": "te5x72yslxUHs4NjGIgQuw", "user_name": "Andrew W.", "business_id": "c_kY-WNaL2OGpDryJQ5aHQ", "stars": 5, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "A great climbing community where strangers cheer for each other.

I ultimately cancelled after weighing the pros and cons for myself.Pros: conveniently located, access to the touchstone gyms is huge. Guest passes twice a month. Decent stuff for sale (though mostly at full retail price). Chill staff with knowledge of local crags (they will let you take pictures of guide books). Music played here was good enough that I didn't ever need to bring my own headphones. Free yoga classes and stuff make the membership much more worth it since you don't also need to go to a separate yoga studio. The bundling of climbing + yoga makes this a compelling deal for anyone who lives in the area.Cons: Parking is really unpleasant if you try coming on a weeknight. They should have arrangements with nearby businesses that gym members can park in certain neighboring spots after 6pm. If you park on 6th street, they start ticketing at 8pm. Factory pl might have an open street parking spot if you're lucky, but you still have to walk kind of far. This is part of the reason I cancelled, because I didn't want to risk parking in neighboring spots and getting in trouble. Maybe I'm just a weenie about it (probably true).This might be a design preference, but I wish that the gym didn't have climbs where you walk off the top. The last couple moves on many climbs are not vertical, and it makes the quality sections of the climb a bit shorter (if the last bit of a climb is just topping out, the sections with the most aesthetic moves will be a lot shorter). I know this replicates many outdoor boulders, but I feel like it shouldn't be the default. Plus if you fall on a climb that is not vertical, you might scrape something. At least in those sections. If the walls were 12ft of very steep sustained climbs I would enjoy that much more.Additionally, I wish the crash pad was only on the areas below particular climbs rather than all over the floor. Plopping down on the middle of the floor after a tough attempt can be kind of awk since you might accidentally get in the way of ppl who are walking. The pit area was nice because there were benches for you to sit. \u00a0I wish that was everywhere because sitting on the floor is a bit annoyingThe grip tape walls allow you to cheat a little bit on some climbs by allowing you to paste your feet and create footholds for yourself. However, it is also unpleasant to scrape your elbow or something on the wall for this reason.Many of the climbs felt more focused on finger strength than power. It probably just happened to be the set of climbs up while I was there, but wow I wish everything was a little less crimpy. This can get you gassed very quickly but not necessarily pumped. There were some other real quality routes though that when I first sent them, were evocative of some amazing outdoor lines that I've climbed. I just wish all the routes were a bit more sustained.The grading can feel a little all over the place. But that's probably the result of putting an explicit number on each climb rather than a color tag which corresponds to a range i.e. red tag blue tag etc.", "date": "9/3/2018"}, {"review_id": "D_q6IhFMbj1HSWJqQRmv7A", "user_id": "PtQ8pZvjE5mbAWgJsa_wwQ", "user_name": "Oscar P.", "business_id": "c_kY-WNaL2OGpDryJQ5aHQ", "stars": 5, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "I go twice a week.

He has great advice on climbing technique, conditioning, equipment, shoes, etc., and I trust his advice and suggestions, and appreciate him taking the time to answer my many questions (I'm a newer climber so need a lot of hand holding at this stage.) I've seen him coaching the youth team and hope to get my nephew involved if scheduling works out around the new school year. Give this young man a raise and/or a promotion as he represents LA Boulders in the best possible light, and seems to genuinely care about the clientele, the company, and the sport in general. Oh - he has great taste in music, too. Doug is also a pleasure to deal with when on duty while I'm there. His pleasant personality and professionalism are truly appreciated and as mentioned earlier, this is becoming more and more rare. Give him a raise, too! They both deserve it!The gym is quite nice although one of the smaller in the Touchstone chain. I like that, though, as it is more intimate and friendly (I think) than the others. Perhaps the parent company could throw a few more $$$ to LA Boulders for promotions, events, etc. It's kind of off the beaten track so unless you're familiar with the Little Tokyo/DTLA Arts District, you might miss out on this great gym.

It costs about $24-25 for a day pass which includes the rental shoe and chalk cost. I'd say we spent about 2.5 hours there. After a while your hands get a little tired and muscles a little fatigued if you aren't used to this form of physical activity. It was common to see friends chilling out laying on the SUPER padded floor while watching another friend attempt a path and suggesting footing positions. I found myself watching them too! It's kind of amazing and crazy how much muscle control and body strength they have to maneuver around the wall to get to the top! The different holdings are color coordinated and labeled based on their level of difficulty! They start at V0 and go up to at least V12. I think my friends and I stuck to the V0-V3; anything higher was much too difficult to even make if half-way up the wall! There's also a small gym inside the facility: cardio machines upstairs near the bathrooms and lockers and weights downstairs off to the side of the rock walls.

By the time I was done for the day, I had a bruised knee and a few scraped knuckles. Its definitely more challenging, but still very fun.I really enjoyed how, for some their climb paths, the climbs lead to the top and allow you to take an easier route down. The other bouldering place didn't have that. I thought that climbing to the top was a fun little extra especially after doing a full climb up. Its just nice to take a small break at the top and view the whole gym.The gym also includes a weight and cardio machine area if you get tired of climbing. Their treadmills seem pretty new.

Went to check it out with some friends on a Sunday afternoon. First, this place is located in a dead end and parking is limited so good luck on that. We had to walk a bit since we couldn't find parking right near the gym. It's a pretty sketchy area too so I'd recommend maybe going early if you're not familiar with the area.Entered the gym and it's a decent size. Their waivers are all electronic (you just fill out the form on their iPad) and a day pass is $20 (pretty steep, but its LA and it's new) So if you're a beginner (like me, this was my 3rd time climbing ever) .. this place might be a bit too overwhelming ... granted you can definitely have fun trying to figure out the V0's because that's the lowest they go in this gym. It was a challenge for me, but I loved watching all the experienced people climb and I was able to get half way on some of the V0's. There were a lot of people so you have to share the wall. They closed at 6pm too, not sure if that's their usual Sunday time or not.Overall, this gym was definitely awesome. I love how clean it was, everything was new...the problems were very challenging and the people that go here definitely know how to climb and you can learn a lot from them. The walls are high and the floors are heavily padded (thank goodness). Only reason I gave 4 stars was that their staff wasn't as friendly as other gyms that I've been too (and that could be because so many people go that it's kinda hard to mingle) and the fact that there's so many people it can get kind of intimidating.

The only drawback to coming here so far is the parking as the lot is tiny and street parking can be packed and gnarly since its in a warehouse area. First of all I just love coming here since they have so many routes to try out! The walls and holds are all new and aren't worn out so it allows you to do harder climbs and have fun without as much worrying about falling. Though if you do fall you have to be more careful since the walls are rough so you could get scraped up. They have a ton of options for every level and for beginners they've even marked off introduction routes to try out first. It's pretty nerve wracking getting to the top and hauling yourself up to the standing area. Then you still need to get down! There's a ton of space so even when it's busy you don't need to worry since everyone gets spread out. Price wise it's $20 for a day pass and additional for rentals. Not bad at all for what you get. The fitness equipment us much better than what you'll find elsewhere and isn't extremely beaten up yet. I also like that they have separate areas for that rather than just squashed into a corner.The staff is pretty nice here and pretty helpful. My friend got injured before even getting into the gym and they helped us out. Being in downtown there was some glass outside that went right through the sole of her shoe and nicked her foot!

It seems like when you first hit the entrance they have the easier routes and you work your way back to harder stuff. The pads here are pretty solid as well. Most gyms have the spring floors with crash pads - this place is one giant crash pad which is pretty cool. They also just re-did the floors in the back gym so that should be pretty nice now.

Boulders I had to \u00a0finally visit the place. I walked in on a Tuesday around noon for the matinee special which is $15 dollars in comparison to the regular $20 bucks which is steep for a day pass but then it is Touchstone. It is a premiere climbing company from up North. :) The staff was super friendly walking in. Filled out the waiver and checked in. Immediately in front of the desk you see the slab wall to the left and one of the major \"boulders\" in front. To the right are the stairs that take you to the locker rooms. Before you walk in you will see a cardio space which only had elliptical machines. The locker rooms still looked unfinished since amenities lacked such as toiletseat covers and shampoo/conditioner in the showers. (Don't know if they will be offering but would be nice!) One major gripe was lack of cubbies. When it got a bit busier later on it was a huge mess of equipment and shoes. I'm sure they will be installed before the major opening tomorrow. Cool thing was the water fountain that dispenses directly into your bottle. Speaking of water, since the entire climbing space is padded they won't allow any liquids onto the space. Which is good, because the padding is the SICKEST part of the space! It's like a mix of tempur-pedic and climb foam. So squishy and I couldn't have myself from making flips and somersaults like I was in the WWF. Now about the walls, I was worried about losing some skin on these \" Walltopia \" walls but surprisingly enough I only had a few souvenirs. I was amazed at how texturized yet still gentle it felt on my feet. My shoes definitely stuck on the walls with minimal effort and can use the wall much more than other walls I've tried. That's the beauty of this wall - curves are streamlined and yet offer a nice challenge with the setting. But be careful of your shoes, the walls will definitely do work on the soles and tops of your shoes. Topping off is one of the most enjoyable parts of this place. Nice practice with what is essential outdoors. Also really liked that they offer down climbing areas. The height with some climbing spots is intimidating yet I didn't seemed too overwhelmed because of how secure I felt with the padding. Holds were good, yet some felt greasy. Also no volumes to be seen? Perhaps the beauty of this place is to emphasize on the boulders themselves with the curves? Setting was soft but then I was climbing with tendonitis so it was nice sending some problems I otherwise wouldn't climb at my home gym. Love the challenge of projecting V3s and V4s.The approach to some problems are interesting and made the trip really worth it. Getting the aesthetic of this place and really was fun. Overall pro/cons. Pros Padding! (best padding I've had the pleasure of falling on!) Water fountain. Towels. Walls are sticky! Little Tokyo around the bend for food. Cons:Lack of parkingLack of ammnenities (unless changed until opening) No cubbies (unless changed until opening) Slackline in the middle of the climbing area (distracting) Mat padding is slightly dirty? For being open for about a month, needs upkeep. Would come back again since the place is reset for the comp/grand opening tomorrow.

I say the only down side is that it can be a bit pricey. My friends and I got there before 3pm and on weekdays it's only $15 if you are there before hand. Shoes cost $4 extra.

Keep in mind, I visited at 9PM on a Tuesday night and I am not all that good at climbing (I consider myself pretty shitty). First its location - in LA, ease of travel and parking are two musts for success - the gym is not far off the 10 and parking is quite abundant at least when I visited. The gym itself is smaller than Dogpatch but for what it lacks in square footage, it makes up for in pure creativity. With La.B, Touchstone packed an equal if not greater punch to its counterpart in a much smaller space; it uses the entirety of its set up with great efficiency. The gym also does not dwell too long on any one wall type - you don't run into a wave stretching from one end of the gym to the other; the walls pose challenges unto themselves with level changes and progressions that make even a simple problem a bit more technical. The route setting is comparable to Dogpatch of late - challenging sends that do not simply value strength but a proficiency in movement. The setters also give you a lot of variety along the V-scale. The thing I'm most happy about, and this may sound OCD, is that they use tape marking instead of hold color. I know, \"who cares?\" Apparently I do as color holds seemed to have been the norm in Southern California (Sender One, Hangar 18) but that's not the case with La.B. The time I visited was perfect - the gym was practically empty. I expect this to change as it did with Dogpatch once people start to hear more about La.B. Also, they do not have the free weights up and running yet - they do have a nice area set aside against the front windows - plenty of space for a couple racks and dumbbells (it's probably twice the size of Mission Cliffs' workout space). Treadmills and cardio machines are good to go upstairs though.

There are times when everyone and their entire social groups take up the walls, and as a solo climber it can be kind of annoying.

And it doesn't seem like there are any viable alternatives when there isn't any parking in the lot. They close at 6pm on the weekends )8 The problems tend more toward the reachy side. I'm small and not very strong, so I really thrive off of crimps and balance problems. A little more diversity in the route setting would be nice, just so I can feel like I can pat my back a bit. On the bright side, I'm forced to work on problems that focus on my weakness.Steep day pass prices ($20) means it's really difficult to bring my n00b friends with me. I use my guest pass when I can, but since we're really only allotted one per month (not including the 4th or last Friday of the month), I end up feeling bad. But not bad enough to pay the $20 for every person I bring. Obviously... Otherwise the membership is $73 I think and that's pretty reasonable considering the quality of the gym. However since the other Touchstone gyms are up north, that cross over membership doesn't seem to be as useful for LA members. To be fair, I think the membership should be adequately cheaper than the norcal gyms until more LA gyms are opened. The routes are rated soft. But I guess I feel better about myself. Or do I... Bouldering only, but this could be a plus for some. (I'd personally like to be more well-rounded than I am)The good- Brand spanking new facility with walls that are still so sticky they scrap your skin and nab the fine seams of your clothing. Sounds bad, but if your clothes can stick to the wall, so can your shoes. Diverse terrain with a consistent rotation of new problems. Since I've been a member (January), I've seen a rotation of about once per month (not including the comp). Welcoming staff members who are very open to helping you with beta or a spot. They'll know you by name after the first few times and you'll never feel pressured into a membership or any other purchase. Laid back but helpful. (Miss you behind the counter, Allen!) Padded floors everywhere. If you want to walk from point A to point B quickly you'll look like Neil Armstrong.It doesn't smell like feet yet, yay! Fellow climbers are all very friendly, non-competitive, helpful and encouraging. I think because it's a newer gym, it took a while for people to start opening up and getting to know each other but it's recently started to get very open and vibrant.Plenty of space to lock up your bicycle, and sometimes even enough space by the front desk-- though recently the gym has been getting more equipment and more members so this probably won't last very long.They close at 11pm on weekdays.They don't seem too class or children's birthday oriented. Which means! More space, no large groups of n00bs (who know little of wall sharing etiquette) and no feeling sorry for accidentally falling on that small child and hearing \"No running!\" every 20 seconds.
