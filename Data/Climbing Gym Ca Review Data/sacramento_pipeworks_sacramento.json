We found Pipeworks and went in to check the place out. It's nothing short of amazing and while we're certainly not experienced climbers, I can't imagine another facility really doing a better job in terms of the bouldering and belay climbing variety and options here. We signed up for a recurring monthly membership but later learned there was a monthly option, which probably would have been the better move for us given the fickle nature of ten year olds. After a few tries, we realized this wasn't the right time for us and when we inquired about cancelling, Jason, the guy who also signed us up, couldn't have been more nice about even making that a great experience for us. The customer service approach they have is second to none and as soon as we're ready to get back out there and give it another try, I wouldn't even consider other options.

The problems here are a bit on the challenging side, but have a good variation to it compared to other places I've been too. Its an awesome place for both beginners and pros climbers alike. They also have a variety of walls. Your typical vertical wall, overhang and I believe its called slab (where the wall is angled at less than 90 degrees). There walls are also fairly taller than other places i've been too which makes it for more of an exciting climb. My review is mainly on the bouldering side of the gym and trust me, You won't be disappointed!

It is more than a rock climbing area - it has a cardio area, weights, yoga, martial arts, body weight training, and even an area to workout with tires! This facility is huge and they're in the process of building a brewery in one of their warehouses, so that'll be cool to check out once it's done. All the rock climbing walls have rocks labeled by difficulty if you want to try and complete a certain color, or you can \"rainbow\" as rock climbers call it. For example, all the pinks on a certain area of the wall could be V0 (easiest) and V1 is the next hardest, which could be black or something. One of the staff members said they switch the climbing routes frequently so that the walls are never the same. That's pretty cool!It's also cool that you can bring your dogs here. There are areas dispersed around the gym where you can tie your dog's leash. There are also cubbies to place your belongings, as well as a locker room with showers. The women's locker room even has a vanity area. A staff member said that Sacramento Pipeworks is Alex Honnold's home gym. Ooo celebrity sighting chance! (He's the first ever person to climb El Capitan with no harness). So maybe one day we can run into him! hahaThe staff is friendly, there are so many things to do here.

It is located in a sort-of \"sketchy\" ares with a lot of homeless nearby. I recommend bringing in any valuables and storing it in the convenient lockers provided by the gym. As a new climber, I was amazed with how large the place was upon first entering. The first thing you see when entering are top-rope routes directly in front, cardio and workout machines behind that, a HUGE bouldering section to the left, and a functional training area with a slack line nearby. The ceilings are high for increased ventilation and the gym is equipped with multiple large fans for the warmer weathered days. I do not have a membership YET but I definitely plan on getting one within the near future. While the membership and daily passes may be on the expensive side, it is definitely worth the investment. Daily passes are about $20 with shoe (~$4) and harness rentals available for an extra cost. But with frequently updated routes, access to other gym equipment and exercises classes, and a crossfit membership add-on available, you will never be bored. The staff and other climbers are some of the friendliest and more supportive people you will meet. Everyone is always so positive and are always happy to lend a helping hand when others are climbing. Most of the climbers here have great climbing manners (patient and respectful) and do not sit or climb underneath you during a climb. I have only bouldered at this location, but the routes are changed frequently which is nice and there is a large variety of different routes accommodating beginning to very advanced level climbers.

Let me count the ways. Actually, that would take too long, so I'll just keep it brief...maybe.I joined in the summer of 2015 because they were running a special, and I was feeling adventurous. I'd never climbed a day in my life, and could stand to lose a couple of pounds (or like...30), so I figured, hey. Time to get in shape enough to climb! So I started going to the spin classes every day and trying out the other equipment--pretty much using everything except the climbing walls, because those were intimidating and terrifying to someone like me, who thought of fitness and \"working out\" as walking a few blocks in midtown to get to my favorite coffee shops. And I've never related to the people whom I refer to as \"the sad muscleheads\" who always look like they want to cry as they curl those weights in front of the mirror, then take swigs of those Mystery Neon Drinks for sustenance. I get it (sort of), but I was definitely looking for a more \"casual\" gym atmosphere where no one would judge my bright neon size L workout pants and discount Nike's.And \"casual\" is a perfect word to describe Pipeworks. First of all, everyone here is friendly. In over a year, I haven't seen much (if any) turnover in staff. To me, this means the people actually give a darn about their jobs and each other. They don't sales pitch you. They always say hello when you check in, and tell you to have a good day when you leave. Plus, sometimes they bring their dogs to work. Oh yeah. A huge perk of being a Pipeworks member: it's dog friendly! The fact that I get to pet dogs after a workout is a huge bonus to me. The only downside of this gym (and actually, most of the other Touchstone gyms I've visited) is that it's located in the crappy side of downtown. Be cautious driving/biking around it, and don't leave any valuables visible in your car. As long as you use common sense, you should be fine. I always think of driving to Pipeworks as like getting to an island. Once you're on the island, you're pretty good to go. Lock up your boat. Er, car. Now, the climbing. It took me 6 months of \"getting in shape enough to climb\" (see also: 6 months of being a scaredy cat) to actually try out climbing. I took the intro to climbing class where they taught me the basics, and I haven't looked back since. The top rope area is like a playground, and the bouldering area is huge (and for me, still challenging!). There's also a lead climbing area, but I have yet to muster up the courage to try that out. It's very easy to lose hours just trying out different routes--and they do a great job resetting them often to shake things up. The classes: they offer spin, yoga, and a few other classes. They also do a lot of climbing series events and instructional workshops. I wish they would add more spin (4 days a week isn't enough!), but they also offer cross fit if that's your thing. Maybe one day I'll brave that side of the wall...but until then, I have my top rope and spin classes. The instructors are all top-notch and super helpful. You won't find this kind of atmosphere anywhere else.

I also appreciated that the staff were chill and didn't push gym memberships on us. To climb, I had to fill out an electronic waiver on an iPad at the front desk and then get the special climbing shoes. I would say go up a half size to a full size if necessary because those shoes seemed to run small. My toes were crossed all crazy inside before I went up a half size! Then we headed to the back area where the bouldering section was. There are large cushioned mats on the floor so you can safely jump/fall down.

From what I can tell, the routes change pretty frequently. I would say that compared to other rock climbing gyms, they rate their top roping routes much more generously.

I've been climbing for 8 months now (at other gyms). On my third trip here, my friend told me that we could get a belay card so that we won't have to belay test every time we visit. This particular worker who tested me wouldn't give me a card despite my smooth and correct belaying and climbing setups because I didn't verbalize certain safety checks like \"double-backing\" my buckle on my harness, when my harness has the automatic mechanism. I know it's probably part of their policy, but I was really really peeved by this!Also strange is that they don't test people on using the proper terminology for climbing. I train my friends who come here to use the phrases \"on belay,\" \"climbing,\" and \"take.\" Safe climbing is all about communication.

There are often young children running around unsupervised, kicking balls and climbing on stuff (not the stuff they are supposed to be climbing on lol). I think what really did me in is that they now have acro-yoga on the main stretching/free weight mats at the time that most people are going to the gym after work. The acro-yoga people try to do cartwheels and headstands and fall over so you have to give them a wide berth if you don't want to get whacked. The trouble is, on the other side of the mats are the slack liners who are also falling off the slack line and you have to give them a wide berth if you don't want to get whacked. \u00a0But there's literally just not enough space.

Each wall has about one or two beginner-amateur routes and then the rest go straight for the gold. The walls do not look real, but they're structured in ways that real rocks are formed, lined with edges and jutting rocks to climb around. Owned by Touchstone Climbing Incorporated, this gym has a route setting team who rotate and ensure there are new routes every 2-12 weeks. If you love climbing and endeavoring to more challenges, Pipeworks creates that for it's climbers.

That's when I came across Pipeworks on yelp. I never really thought about rock climbing before. I'm a tad bit scared of heights and have weak upper body strength. Luckily, my friend was interested in joining me. We decided to take the intro to climbing class ($29). The instructor taught us the basics of knot tying, belaying, and climbing. On my first climb, when the instructor told me to lean back in order to get down, I told her I didn't think I can do that. I was scared of falling. It's a matter of trust though, and if you knot correctly, then you'll be fine. After our knowledge was tested, we were free to make use of the climbing walls on our own. There are two reasons why I knocked off a star. The first being that it was hot inside; the fans didn't help much. The second reason is because the instructor was a bit rude when we checked in at the front desk. She seemed annoyed that she had to teach the class to my friend and I. During the class, she was helpful and knowledgeable but the initial impression was not favorable.Overall, I had a lot of fun, more fun than I thought I would've! It made me nervous when the holds were tiny and I may not always have made it to the top, but it was still a great experience. I'll try to climb higher next time.... maybe. (As part of the class, we were also given a free day pass for us to come back.) I walked away with a few bruises on my legs, and sore arms (the next day) but also a sense of pride and accomplishment. :)", "date": "8/29/2013"}, {"review_id": "vO2DTau7qNjAAyzudOQCXQ", "user_id": "po4CU_f9nrpNeQm5p0MCPw", "user_name": "Matthew M.", "business_id": "4dniG36pDnqpPXfQGQDhZg", "stars": 5, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "text": "Pipeworks is hands down the best gym I have ever been a member of. \u00a0I was a member last year when I lived in Sacramento. \u00a0Unfortunately in 2013 I moved to the LA area for work but I make a point of visiting Pipeworks every time I am in Sacramento. \u00a0The members of this gym are amazing and extremely nice. \u00a0The same is true of the staff who are not only extremely helpful but genuinely friendly, especially Tahnee, Kristen, and Natalie. \u00a0It is very obvious that they are climbing enthusiast who love where they work and enjoy being part of the Sacramento climbing scene. \u00a0I love how Pipeworks has a fully stocked weight lifting gym with quality equipment along with boxing heavy bags and great cardio equipment. \u00a0And it goes without saying that the climbing walls along with the bouldering area is top class. \u00a0Just an absolutely amazing gym!", "date": "12/24/2013"}, {"review_id": "nLsFJtFJNYwUZTtyT3N5SA", "user_id": "FM4zVQe5B9WMZM_JjDyvSA", "user_name": "Tiffany L.", "business_id": "4dniG36pDnqpPXfQGQDhZg", "stars": 5, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Best touchstone climbing gym I've been to so far.

For your climbing needs- there are several walls and difficulty levels to try out plus boulder climbing area. I was impressed that they care enough to test you before you get started and they make sure you know what you're doing and you're not putting yourself in danger or your partner's when they're climbing. I had to know the 'points of safety' and how to belay. I didn't get it right the first time but they were patient and came back to check me again. Our guy was really helpful and explained the belaying techniques to me. Finally I passed and was ready, with shaky legs to do my first climb. It was a great experience and can't wait to try again. \u00a0BTW- you can check out an ipad from them I guess to use while you're on one of the cardio machines.

Anyways being a first timer, I didn't know there were levels and actual \"routes\" you take to climb your way to the top. This makes it an actual challenge, I suppose. But man, what a hard workout - you're your arms and legs. I have like no upper body strength so now, a few days later, I'm still sore and hurting. The worse was the day after though. I guess if you come here regularly, that's not an issue. I was able to complete one route fully without cheating so I was happy, being my first time. Oh and don't forget to bring your own chalk to protect your hands. If I go back, I hope to accomplish more and maybe try straightforward rock climbing.

They had all the equipment and free weights that I like to use, as well as climber specific gear.The gym is a haven for the kids.

By 8pm, attendance seemed to have peaked and still any route we sought was ready and available... AWESOME; no pressure to rush a climb, no intimidation of crowds or peering eyes, no din of noise... quite peaceful for regular climbers and a welcoming environment to new/beginning climbers.The bouldering area is comprised of three alcoves, much of which offering naturals, features, and overhangs, making even the V0/1/2s more demanding than I've encountered at other facilities.For the lead/rope walls, it appears that the routes are evenly distributed between lead and top-rope (where as other gyms have top-ropes on most routes with lead clips as an option on about half). \u00a0Featuring (at least two prominent) arches, lengthy negatives, varying steeps, and jutting overhangs, the climbing here is fun and engaging.

And if (when?) I want to learn to climb, there are flyers all around the gym with info about private climbing instructors who teach all levels. 3) \u00a0The community. Climbers in general, and Pipeworks members in particular, are really cool people. The energy in Pipeworks is unique, and very different from any other gym in the area (I've been to many so I can say that with confidence!) It's like summer camp for adults. 4) The extras. Like the bike club. You can find the email list at the front desk. Sign up and every week you get an announcement telling you about their upcoming ride on Saturday morning. They're definitely a social club, everyone's really friendly, and they offer rides that appeal to all levels. \u00a0Finally, I just have to add that my membership fee was actually reduced earlier this year.

For starters, the location and atmosphere makes it feel like a real gym. It's located downtown in an urban warehouse that gives off an industrial setting. The gym is pretty spacious with a separate bouldering area and numerous routes. The hieght of the walls is what impresses me and is definately perfect for those looking to work on their endurance. There's a secluded section towards the front which is perfect for those learning to climb or simply just to warm up. The dedicated bouldering space is not as extensive and can probably expand on beginning levels. Most of the routes I saw were V4 or higher. The locker rooms are comparable to the size of a regular gym (such as 24 hr fitness). The staff is pretty friendly and approachable as well.
