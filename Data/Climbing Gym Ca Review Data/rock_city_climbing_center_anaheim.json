I recommend doing for anywhere from 20 to 30 people, because we had 26 people and the room was JUST the right size. Any more than 30 and it would have felt crammed. The pricing here for a party is such a great deal because the kids get a fun experience and you get the party room. You can bring your own food, decoration & they even have a fridge you can keep perishables in. However you get only two hours with the party package but Can add an additional hour for $75. \u00a0I wish I would have added that extra hour! I felt like by the time the kids started getting the hang of rock climbing it was already 1 hour down. If I could do this again the extra hour is a must. Again this faculty and staff were awesome!

I have never heard of many of my friends coming in to this gym so I saw the reviews and figured I'd give it a try. I have never been more disappointed in a climbing gym. The owner was running the front desk, not friendly at all, and seemed bothered by having to check new people in. My friend had to rent equipment and it was old and DIRTY. Moving into the actual climbing area, I have never seen a dirtier gym. That place hasn't seen a good wash probably ever. The mats are old, lumpy, crusty, dirty, and definitely lack cushion. Now moving onto actual climbing. The holds are so full of dirt you can't even see the color of them. Doesn't look like routes have been changed in a long time. But the worst part, the ropes are OLD, sticky, and not adequately placed to ensure climbers are safe on different routes. Additionally, the ropes are anchored to the ground. You don't tie in as the belayer. You just pull the rope through the grigri that is anchored into the ground. It is very foreign to me to do that, and is not proper climbing technique. Getting the rope through the grigri is almost impossible because of sticky residue all over it. Overall, this place is not for avid climbers. I think it's more catered to little kids and their parents who don't know any better and are just looking for entertainment. If you actually want to climb and be safe and challenged at the same time, literally ANY OTHER GYM is better than this. It's a cool layout and has the potential to be awesome if anyone cared to maintain it and upkeep it.", "date": "4/5/2019"}, {"review_id": "INhW2lYRK9u_BVeRTPkItg", "user_id": "D4mYL3ijAenC_jHSKSFyPg", "user_name": "Chris S.", "business_id": "i_bedMZOzBBQIJjW-mF_3w", "stars": 5, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Great boulder gym in the area.

It was ~$20 for a day pass, climbing shoes, and a bag of chalk.

If so, you should hit up Rock City.Most of the gym is for bouldering, but there's a small area for top-roping, but if you're looking to rope up and have a harness strangle your boys downstairs (something only men truly understand), then you're better off going to SenderOne (LAX or Santa Ana) as the walls at Rock City aren't particularly tall. \u00a0Besides if you're going to strap on a harness and squeeze Jasper and Reggie down there, you might as well get on a really long climb which would not be Rock City.Ratings for the problems are easier than the Factory, but harder than Cliffs of Id. Sender would be between Rock City and Cliffs in my humble opinion. Being a smaller gym the route settings are definitely more creative since there are obvious roofs, slab top outs, and crazy overhangs.The staff at Rock City is very friendly and the it has a nice neighborhood gym feel.

Difficulty: Not bad for my first time. At first everything seems impossible to do, but it's only a matter of some confidence and descent skill to get started. Every wall is rated by the difficulty level. 5.5 is the easiest and the hardest is 5.11. The rating measures the incline and level of rock grip. I have to admit, you do need upper body strengths and some endurance to handle the climbing. Experience: I had a blast! My greatest fear is heights, so I was a bit skeptical at first but with practice I got more comfortable. I didn't reach the top but I got pretty close. Overall, such a fun experience.

I really enjoyed myself out there, albeit the scorching sun and dry weather. Still, I didn't want to drive out 200 miles into the desert just to climb some rocks. Sure, I could go to a cliff somewhere and try to do that, or pretend I was a gecko at work and try climbing the brick walls (not that I did). Instead, he pointed me to this place and after a year of absence, I came back here and it felt like I never left.ATMOSPHERE: 4 starsThe place is located inside a business center and if you weren't looking, you would completely miss it. Who would think to build and place rock climbing walls inside a business building? The fine people at Rock City did. The place is great. Open space, crash pads on the floor, and walls to be climbed. Even if you're new, the place is welcoming and invites exploration. Don't be afraid.STAFF: 5 starsThe staff is chill. Maybe it's because they enjoy their job. Maybe it's because they're helping people who are also chill. Or maybe, just maybe, because they get paid very very high wages. Nah. I'm pretty sure it's the first two. Whatever the reason, the staff is knowledgeable and completely there for you if you need something. Just don't be afraid to ask, especially if you're new.COMMUNITY: 5 starsLike most communities, the common interest of people really get them friendly. Here is no exception. The rock climbing is fun and if you ever have difficulty ascending a path, there are plenty of people who will give you advice. All you have to do is look. Here, even if you come alone, you don't have to feel alone.VARIETY: 4 starsIf you come here often, you might get bored after a while if there aren't challenges for you. Luckily, there are plenty of paths to be had, and they change out the grips into different paths every month or so. They could use a little more work on labeling some of the path difficulties, but overall, easy to use.CONCLUSIONWhether you are an avid rock climber or just an enthused noob, the place is a great find for all those who enjoy climbing. Although you might not be sure at first, give it a chance and I'm sure you'll enjoy it (even those who just want to see some eye candy). They even have rappelling and paths for kids.

The left most side of the gym is for top rope with some of the same holds used for traversing.

It's very well priced, and has a no-frills sort of energy.Compared to my new gym (which feels like I've upgraded to some ritzy version that I'm so lost and confused in), it's a great place to start out/practice/hangout, and if it were closer, I'd probably still be there.", "date": "7/5/2013"}, {"review_id": "NVoV0EiuT6tKvkMVQ-bLQg", "user_id": "47BfAFyLpGflmR-pn7gmJA", "user_name": "Olin C.", "business_id": "i_bedMZOzBBQIJjW-mF_3w", "stars": 4, "useful": 2, "funny": 2, "cool": 0, "text": "No AC is a big turn-off during summer time.

I've always wanted to go rock climbing, but it was always a) I wasn't wearing the proper shoes (i.e., the wall you see at fairgrounds), b) never found someone to go with, or the most often c) I absolutely have NO upper body strength. My boyfriend and I scoured around the area for fair-priced rock climbing centers, and we decided to go to Rock City only because it was super close to home, and they did offer harnesses. I wasn't paying attention to the fees, but I think it was $17 per person incl the harness. We also had to pay $3 for the shoes, absolutely not paying attention to their current deal on their board ($5 for shoes, harness, & chalk...but wasn't sure if it was for members or non-members).Anyways, I feel that it was a well-sized gym; I think the walls stood about 25 feet give-or-take. Lots of routes and I think they had about 2 small rooms with very acute angled walls (like, 45 degree angles), which stood at about 12-13 feet tall. My bf and I didn't dare go into the caves, haha. It's super dark, and according to the signs, about up to 11 ft drops...and it reeked of musk and sweaty feet--on top of that, I am slightly claustrophobic anyways lol. This gym has a great atmosphere, I feel that I was NEVER judged by other climbers, even when I fell off the wall so many times )= I was complaining to my bf on this one wall on how I couldn't get up right, and despite that I was cheered on by another climber that I should still give it a try--what great sportsmanship!We spent a good 2-3 hours until our forearms and hands felt tired. I think about $15-18 worth to climb for the whole day, opening til' closing of the gym, is an excellent deal. They do offer memberships varying from monthly to annually. I'm thinking of coming back here again in about 3-4 weeks.

In a span of 2-3 hours..1) The first one was a straight wall up and down and was a good one to overcome at the beginning.2)The second one was slanted and being only 5'3 I had to grapple and jump for several rocks. I had to do this one several times because I'd miss or arms would die on me. After so many rests and attempt it was so great just reaching out my right arm and touching the tape at the top. I almost couldn't support myself and touch that tape. It'd be such a shame!3) The third one was climbing up a slanted wall and then going over the top and getting to the second story. With some guidance I got to do this one. It took so many tries and just swinging mindlessly and hopelessly on the rocks to finally get this one. Ahhh, small accomplishments but nevertheless I was surprised at myself for being able to rockclimb. I honestly imagined myself just hanging one feet from the bottom because I would suck at it. It's such an advantage to be tall and have buff arms. The guys basically did pull ups the whole time and didn't need to swing and jump to grab rocks -_______-$15 got us a whole day pass to rock climb to your heart's desire with rock climbing shoes included. I was satisfied with 1.5 hours, 2 hours was pushing it.Also.... we went on a hot day. It was pretty humid in there and smelled like feet. Another also, the owner is not very professional though he is nice. He threw shaved iced at me for fun when my back was turned.... I was slightly irked but cooled myself down (pun!). He could've just given me a free shaved ice cone.", "date": "10/16/2012"}, {"review_id": "2_eNBhumphjqDXQBXOpZNA", "user_id": "fHqEjcCn2R5WVR9otfdSBA", "user_name": "Jessica L.", "business_id": "i_bedMZOzBBQIJjW-mF_3w", "stars": 5, "useful": 4, "funny": 0, "cool": 2, "text": "I can't say much bc this is my first time going rock climbing but i LOVED it. \u00a0It's quite cheap ($15 incl shoes). \u00a0I believe it's another $3 if you want to get a harness and the chalk bag is $1 (we didn't have to get this bc our friend is a member here and already had a chalk bag). \u00a0I think there were 3 diff rooms and there are diff paths marked w diff tapes. \u00a0The vibe is very friendly there. \u00a0They also have tunnels inside. \u00a0It's very dark so you'll need a flashlight or get a glow stick from them.

There are more than a handful of people that will show beginners the ropes, help intermediate, and suggest new things to people that climb at higher levels. When I first started I found it very easy to ask for help and advice and progressed quickly because of it. Now I am happy to be in the role of a helpful climber to anyone who needs it.

Price - You cant beat the price of Rock city it is a few bucks cheaper than anywhere around for a day pass and a whole lot cheaper for annual membership. at the time of writing there has been several groupon deals that allow for cheap monthly access as well. The groupons happen often and I can only assume that it will stay that way.3. Staff - The people who work at rock city as well as the owner are all helpful and friendly.

It seems like every time I go to a different gym I have to prove myself on a harder grade climb before people start coming up to give a little extra beta (advice) on the route. This place is very concentrated on bouldering, and actually has much tougher routes (in terms of grade) than other gyms I've been too. There are enough \"easy / moderate\" routes that help you learn form and technique so it's pretty good for someone to learn. The top ropes range from amazingly easy to damn near impossible, but the selection isn't as grand as Hangar18. There are also a few lead climb routes, but again not as much as Hangar18..I signed up on my own in the beginning of 2011, but I honestly can't think of a day when I've actually climbed alone...

After our experience at another gym in the area, we weren't expecting much... We walked in on a Monday at around 7:30pm and it was PACKED!! We were a bit concerned because there were people just everywhere. We made our way to the front desk and talked to the guy there. He was super friendly and totally understood our concern. He said that someone had double booked boy scout troops thinking they were the same group. He told us to just fill out the liability waiver and climb away, saying that we could pay him at the end if we ended up climbing for a while. Wait... Really?? That's awesome!! He made us feel like he genuinely cared that we had a good time and wasn't just trying to get some $$ out of us. So... About the problems. We only bouldered, so I can't judge the top rope/lead routes. Just as a note, the walls are pretty short, at least compared to what I'm used to. There were multiple bouldering areas - including a top out boulder, a small low hanging bouldering cave and various other surfaces ranging from slab to over-hanging. All the problems were taped, holds weren't overly greasy or chalky and the problems were FUN!! There was a wide variety of difficulty levels. Most of the problems were graded because they had recently had a competition that used points instead of a V rating system. The only problems that were clearly graded were the pink tape (VB) and yellow tape (V0) problems. Everyone that was there - staff and climbers - were very friendly. The environment was chill - after all the kiddos left - and encouraging.The cost of a bouldering only day pass is very reasonable ($12). We had our own gear so we didn't have to rent anything. The place is a bit difficult to find. There is a map in the parking lot that we used to find the right building.

Good place for the kids to get excited about, but not really the best experience from a parent's perspective. Place was really rundown. Had lumpy, torn and exposed carpeting that the kids trip over. It was in the back corner of a business lot and so it was hard to find. The gym was really crowded and gettin a litle dangerous with all of the grown men climbing and jumping around the kids and not looking at all where they were climbing around the kids. We waited forever to be helped and we were just dumped into the back party room until the employee had time to deal with us. He was really short and impatient with the kids and then completely ignored us. It was a bit frustrating and chaotic and the guy behind the counter could have been more helpful. It would have been more helpful if there was more than one person working that day.Thank God that the kids don't really care about anything as long as they're distracted by the fun climbs and tunnel system, which was pretty neat. My kid had fun and it was an interesting experience but I don't think I'll be doing this again, at least not for a kid's party anyhow. Maybe better to just take your kid there by yourself instead of booking a big party because the gym just isn't equipped to handle that many kids. Also, it was kind of a rip-off when you consider that you only get the gym for a couple hours and only HALF of the gym to climb so that you stay out of the other climbers way. The price of a normal climbing pass gets you an entire day and the whole gym access.I'd recommend Rockreation over this place.

Rock City is thus far my least favorite rock gym, for top-roping (I only top-rope right now, though I hope to learn lead sometime next year).I was aghast by how run-down and dirty the place was, first of all. They needed more cubbies too. But more importantly, the Gri-gris there were difficult to use, leading to very unpleasant, jolting lowerings from the wall. They seemed old and were also attached to the floor in a strange manner. Next, the walls across from each other were often situated so close together that descending or falling climbers would swing into other climbers or belayers. I haven't really seen this issue elsewhere. I don't want to hate on children, but there were a lotttt of children here as well, which made the climbing experience very loud/noisy. The rock walls were short and lacked features, and the holds were often insanely slippery; they were probably decades old...or sweaty? In addition, it was hard to see the route while climbing because routes were indicated by tape rather than the color of the holds. The placement of the tape (under the rock) inhibited the visibility of the tape.The routes themselves were difficult, to say the least. The 5.10s were mostly not marked by subcategories. I tried all the 5.10s and managed to complete maybe 3 or so (this was back in July/August), while totally failing on most. 5.9s weren't too easy either. I slipped off the rocks several times during my climbs. On the plus side, I enjoyed the climbing rope, as well as the relatively cheap prices (I believe it was about $14 for a day pass)...but I would pay a couple more dollars in a flash to go to another gym. I see that this gym has an overwhelming proportion of very positive reviews, and I have wondered why. After perusing the reviews, I believe that positive reviews may be from boulderers or from new climbers (when I was there, I noticed that no other top-ropers were actually climbing routes...). Verdict: Hate the gri-gris here, the slippery rocks, difficult-to-see route markers, noisiness, and spacing issues.

Since then, Ive climbed at both Hangar 18s, both Vital locations, Threshhold, Truhold, and several outdoor climbing spots.Unbiased Opinion (sort of)This gym is the best climbing gym to get your feet wet in the climbing world(If that is something you choose) for the following reasons:-Cost: You wont find a better deal for a membership anywhere especially for what you can accomplish at this gym.-Atmosphere: The crowd is fun, and a great place to hang out with your friends before you go out on the weekends. For the most part they play great music, and people go OUT OF THEIR way to help and encourage you. Personally I havent seen that at any of the gyms I listed except for 1(Vital). It makes your climbing experience that much better in the beginning. -Staff: The owner works most of the time during the day, so he's there to see and meet his customers. The Employees are all educated climbers, who can give you endless advice on all things climbing on a begginer-expert level. No one is there to nickel and dime you, and they take the time to teach you the basics of top roping/bouldering.-Route Setting: I personally climb 3's with an occasional hallelujah 4 climb. They have some of the most thoughtful and unique settings that I have yet to experience anywhere else, and on every level of climb. I say that with confidence because I have dear friends that are climbing animals and a few that climb professionally. The top ropes are a nice change up on occasion but the focus of that gym is bouldering period.Rock City vs. Other Gyms:From what I've experienced at my level of climbing, I get a great workout at the other facilities and have never felt so pumped. BUT my sessions are just that.... A workout. I learned all of my technique from the challenges at Rock City, and the advice from the experienced fellow climbers and staff. I live in Mission Viejo/Lake Forest area, and OF COURSE I can climb regularly at a closer facility but I wont. I climb about 3 or 4 times a week (which is a whopping 175 miles on average) if I can, and the cost to drive there has paid for itself for what this gym has given me. If anything I owe them :) I personally feel that if I started anywhere else, I never would have stuck with climbing, which is the trend for my athethletic ventures.

First off, I have to say that everyone ( staff and rock climbers ) were super friendly, helpful, and supportive! For anyone that isn't very familiar (which I wasn't at all)- bouldering is climbing the walls without harness. The walls aren't hazardously high and the floor is padded pretty well so if you fall, there isn't much danger but still alarming when your up there. This gym has various routes in different colors (you must go up the wall with just the rock in your color) and variation of difficulties ( VB[easiest] to V9 [hardest]maybe even 12 or higher). I could do up to V1, I blame my stubby fingers but I'm working up!They also have imitated caving tunnels that are pretty fun and kinda scary if your claustrophobic.

Yeah it has a bit of a sweaty feet smell, and some of the carpet covering the padding is slightly torn, but trust me the carpet wont eat you up. Overall the experience my gf and I, as well as my other homies have had was Great. From what I understand the bouldering problems change after a few months so they have fresh routes regularly.

As far as the guys working the front desk I only have a complaint about 1 person, and if you go often you'll know who i'm talking about.
