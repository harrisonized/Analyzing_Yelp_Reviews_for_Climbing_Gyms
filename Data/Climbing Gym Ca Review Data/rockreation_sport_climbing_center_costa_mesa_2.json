The staff well extremely helpful and helped create such a positive experience for customers that will have you coming back for more. When you first enter the facility you will have to fill out an online waiver and pay the entrance fee. After that you will be given a small orientation on how to use the facility. The facility has a gym, yoga studio, auto belay (a safety rope for your harness that lets you down slowly) rock walls, and staff who are willing to help you belay up the rock walls. After your orientation you will be suited up with a harness and you can rent some rock climbing shoes if needed. I recommend you renting a pair of rock climbing shoes if you would like to climb the harder rocks but it is not necessary. When you finish up with suiting up it's time to climb! The rocks have difficulty labeled on them starting at 5 (which is like climbing a ladder) to 11 (the really advance stuff). I recommend starting at 5 and working your way up. Alternative if you don't like climbing high they have a side of the gym designated for bouldering.Overall I had a positive experience and was really thankful for the high energy staff who made me feel comfortable belaying me up the wall and guiding me from the ground.

Fridays they have a special for 10$ day pass and 5 dollar rentals (shoes) I'm not sure how much harness/chalk is for rock climbing. I checked in for free chalk so it was super cheap for the day pass!! instead of 18$ day pass. I'm pretty newbie with bouldering, I can only do v0-v1. I don't know the whole cross over, finger strength, \"on/offs\" what have you for finessing this sport, but it's still a lot of fun for me. I prefer bouldering over rock climbing because you don't really need another person there to do the rope for you, BUT, I did see a kid climbing on an area where the rope is attached for you?? So he basically was able to rock climb himself safely, which I thought was cool. The facility is clean, I like the mini gym in the back.

They have an arbitrary \"gym policy\" of no gri-gris. They say gri-gris promote \"inattentive belaying\" but this is old-timey, backwards thinking. Studies have proven that you are much less likely to have an accident using a gri-gri versus a tube-styled belay device.The reason I gave this place two stars instead of just one is because they recently remodeled their bathrooms and they're beautiful. If I had to rate just the bathroom it would be 5/5, I would definitely poop there again. Who would I suggest this gym for? Parents who are looking for something to do for their kid's birthday. They won't notice the difference that it's a terrible gym and they can just add to the yelling and screaming.

Decent top rope area if you've taken a class with them or else they won't let you use any of the two person belay options. It was a close drive for me. Has a gym with showers. The bouldering side is okay.Cons: $50 for two people including shoes is a bit high compared to other places.. especially due to the fact that my significant other and I were limited to only the auto belays and bouldering. The auto belay climbs were way too easy for me. I don't rock climb very often and when I do it's generally not that difficult regardless of what I do, but the climbs here had me bored before the first hour was over. The only thing I could do was to see how fast I could climb up the rocks or try to make it slightly more difficult by using only a certain color or something. Ended up just helping the gf figure out how to climb up certain climbs because she was having trouble with a few. Bouldering is pretty limited as well. I spent a little bit of time there, but there just wasn't that much. You're forced to take a class to use the other stuff. So more $$ to spend. Never had to do that with the other places that I've been to.Bottom line: I think I'll go elsewhere. My fault for coming here out of convenience. Oh and one more thing. There was this other couple there.. or I think they were a couple or something, but the guy kept looking over at me especially while I was climbing and I felt like some of the stuff he was saying out loud while talking to the girl working there and the girl that he was with had more intention besides just for conversation between the three of them... Plzzz... how old are you?... I rock climb maybe twice a year. I came here with a tshirt and jeans and you're here with your workout stuff and walking around without a shirt like you own the place lol..

They are extremely friendly and knowledgable.2) Great prices. For $12/hour of climb time with someone to belay you or $16 for a day pass, to me this place is a steal. 3) All abilities come here and you'll find variety on the climbs. Becuase the prices are so good and the staff is welcoming, you see parents here letting their gradeschoolers try it for the first time on up to lead climbers who are clearly experienced both on real rock and in the gym.

It's a pretty decent rock climbing gym, I would even say that it was the best place to toprope in the OC/LA area prior to Sender One's opening. The membership here is still a lot cheaper than Sender One, but the day pass is comparable so I am interested in how business will go here.It's quite spacious and clean compared to Hangar 18 and Rock City, and members have access to a gym. There is a pretty decently-sized lead, bouldering, traverse and top rope area. I've only toproped so I can only speak to this. They have some pretty good routes here and a lot of interesting wall features, including slabs, overhangs, cracks, and chimneys. Some of the holds are older but most of them are still quite usable. I find that Rockreation is good for getting stronger--it's definitely less technical than UCI (where I most often climb), but those overhang moves are quite challenging. They put up new routes fairly often too. I'd say that Rockreation is pretty beginner friendly. In terms of the grades, it's pretty standard, so slightly harder than Planet Granite in Norcal but easier than other gyms in the OC/LA. I find that the difference between about 5.10c/d, and 5.11a is pretty steep though. I usually toprope at 5.10c or 5.10d here.There are some downsides of Rockreation as well. The staff is not always professional, though it is really just one person whom I am thinking about who is veerrrrry slow and out-of-it all the time, I think he is on drugs.

Super friendly, very helpful [including for new climbers like myself], and just fun to be around for a couple hour session. Climbing is about the community and this place gets a solid 5 for having such an open one.3. Bouldering. It's not the biggest area I've used, or the most cleanly marked, but there's a ton of different style walls, a big variety of problems and frequent changes to keep things fresh. One of the most unique features is the features built into the wall... I've never seen a gym with as many natural holds as this place has.4. Wall Climbs. Unfortunately this just isn't what it could be... The walls are pretty short for when and there isn't enough space to get a huge variety of climbs in at any one level. Seems like most of the setting is in the boulder area then lead rope and top rope here and there.5. The Gym. I doubt many people sign up for their weights but they do have a solid assortment of machines, free weights, even some cardio.

Single-looped rope on top rope routes 2. They don't allow use of Gri-gris (auto-locking belay devices) These two issues combine to make climbing extremely dangerous and frustrating. My husband weighs about 100 lbs more than me, and though I've been an avid climber and safety nut for 10 years, I don't trust my ability to belay him without a gri-gri and such little tension around the top rail.

This was my first time going there, I knew getting certified to top rope belay and lead climb would be a time consuming process. Since there was only one person at the desk, he alternated between testing the three of us and checking people in. After the top rope belay test, he told us it would be a few minutes before he could test us for lead. Every 10 minutes I would ask again, and eventually he told me that he was waiting for another employee to start at 4pm to test me. Keep in mind this was at 3:30, and If I had not asked, I would have been awkwardly bouldering up and down the top rope corner waiting to test indefinitely.After eventually finishing the lead certification at 4:20, we tried a few of the routes. And I like them. Lots of unique features and sufficiently long. The top rope on the other hand, was pretty poor. A lot of the routes felt awkward and not very smooth to climb, and very short.

I haven't had much experience with other gyms (3 total), but the technical possibilities on these walls were wonderful. Such a refreshing relief from yet another gym of carbon-copy flat walls. Go climb a bouldering route where you don't have any feet for half the wall and tell me you can go back to having set feet again. - For an average sized gym, they pack in a ton of good climbing. There is a decent amount of bouldering, with good variety in the type of route. There's even a crack in the corner, and a traverse section for practicing along the wall. Toss in your standard top roping and dedicated lead-climbing section and you have something for everyone. - Staff is friendly and helpful, as you'd hope. Routes are set in interesting ways, although you should be aware that the bouldering may be graded a good deal harder than what you're used to (I dropped by 2 grades).Not so awesome- Not much here, except it just isn't that large. I will admit to having been spoiled by Sunnyvale Planet Granite in terms of sheer size and number of routes. - If you're new, don't expect to be able to boulder unless you have serious athleticism.
