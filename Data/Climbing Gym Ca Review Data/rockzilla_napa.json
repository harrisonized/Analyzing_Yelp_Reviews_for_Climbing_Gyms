SHORT NAILS!! I always kick myself when I forget to file down my nails before coming out here. It's not about breaking nails, it's annoying because you won't be able to grasp the holds properly. 2. Saturday mid-day (probably Sunday too) is when all the children have their parties. I like to come towards the evening on a Saturday or in the middle of the week.3. Don't wear short shorts. The harness comes to about mid-thigh. You'll be more comfortable if you have longer shorts or pants on. In general stretchy-movable (yes, i just made up that word) clothes are the way to go.4. You can save money by bringing your own gear. They'll take money off of the entrance fee if you bring your own climbing shoes and/or harness.I've been here about 4 times and every time I have a great experience. The owner is very personable, we usually end up talking about one thing or another. And he is always walking around to make sure people are doing okay, which makes me feel a little safer.

Visiting in Napa for 5 days, we were looking for something for our son (4 years old) and cousin (5 years old) to do rather than watch us drink and be merry.We were actually heading our way to Scientopia Discovery Center but unfortunately it was closed to the public on Mondays and Tuesdays. However, the owner was nice enough to open the door while I was awkwardly trying to get someone's attention through their window. She then recommended rock climbing at Rockzilla located \"around the block\".In terms of location, the building was a little difficult to find. It is located next to a bouncehouse and a building that manufactures shelves or something like that. However, if you can get past your suspicions of whether you have arrived at the right place or not, you will be so pleasantly surprised at Rockzilla.The kids at first were hesitant to climb so the owner busted out a bouncehouse for the kids to play. Meanwhile, my husband and I spotted each other on various courses of rock climbing (this was actually the first time when we went to a \"formal\" rock climbing training area and were so pleasantly surprised by the fun we had rock climbing). We do suggest that, if you plan to go here, do so with a partner so that you can take turns spotting each other.Once the kids saw us rock climb, they wanted to try to do so as well. The owner was nice enough to let the kids try a climb or two before we had to pay for their climb. (Prices are extremely reasonable and passes are good for the entire day). The children had their own climbing wall where a \"suspension\" system allowed them to climb without parents officially \"spotting\" them. Overall, we had a wonderful time.

As a matter of fact this is my very first time to write a comment. I had my son's 7th bday party there last Saturday 12/28. The owner was cool and very accomodating. He set an inflatable jumpie for younger kids w/c was not even part of the package, Free!I informed him in advance that there would be about 20 kids total but eventually more parents decided to climb too so we pretty much filled up the entire place. One instructor assigned to us and his presence was visible during the entire 3-hr party.You are allowed to bring your own party food too! The best part is the price, it's very reasonable! I highly recommend Rockzilla, they ROCK!!!

It was very fun and easy. The staff took really good care of our group and helped the kids with the climbing gear and walls when they needed help. They had a jumpy house up near the picnic tables and it worked out great for the younger siblings who weren't interested in climbing yet. We come here for play dates periodically and are always impressed. Since we have been coming both our kids have dramatically improved their skills and confidence. It's a gem in Napa and we feel lucky to have something so great for our kids. We only have to drive 5 minutes to get to it and we think it's very affordable for what they offer.

Rockzilla, is a beginner to expert level indoor rock climbing facility that is the North Bay's answer to \"Planet Granite\" in the South Bay, though not a chain! Rockzilla is locally owned and operated by next door business neighbor \"PB & J's-which is a indoor \"jumpy house\" facility for kids, with successful summer camps programs for elementary and middle school kids. I found out about Rockzilla by word of mouth as they don't advertise much but are apparently known well in serious climbing circles. They have harnesses for everyone and scales of difficulty that start with beginner children even down to the toddler age on the boulder area with belay instruction and help and all the way up to \"V Hard\" rated overhanging arches on the main climbing walls, that were designed by expert level climbers! Day passes or memberships are available and cost is reasonable and big fun factor, they stay open late, have a workout-warm up area, classes and summer camps to. Me and my 9 year old son loved climbing like spiderman up the rock walls and repelling down, with plenty of challenges around each corner of this large facility. It can be hard to find as it's tucked away in Napa's old warehouse district but just a few blocks of Trancas St., a main business area and just up the street from the new Westin. Day treks to Birthday parties and corporate events, the weather is never a factor as you have lots of space indoors! I've not been there when it was too crowded and it seems like they make sure everyone has enough space on the walls and break/eating tables.Bottom line: It's a great workout, fun, good service and brings out the kid in us all!
