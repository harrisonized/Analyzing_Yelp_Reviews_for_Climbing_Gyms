At least when I've been to this location, it's rarely ever crowded which is great because my home gym in Sunnyvale feels like Disneyland. The lines can get long when waiting for routes to climb or even bouldering. This location is a bit smaller but never did I have to ask if a person was switching or not. That was nice for a change. There are two bouldering areas and the fitness area is all upstairs. I've taken the yoga classes here and I really like taking it with Nadia. I use to go to Doris's classes too at Sunnyvale, but it's hard getting up for that 6:15am class. However her core yoga class is great for the hip flexors.

I used to be snobbish and sworn to only go to dedicated yoga studios. After I went through teacher's training last summer, some of my yogi classmates highly recommended trying out a few classes at PG. I took Nadia and Doris classes, oh dear, they are not for the faint hearted! These yoga classes are geared towards conditioning the core for climbing, target strengthening of climbing muscle groups ( e.g. hip flexors, glutes), as well as functional movement patterns that mimics climbing. I come out of these classes more broken (in a good way) than a hard climbing session. One of the best teachers I've ever had (Edwina) as well as my classmate (Jen) are both teachers there, which says a lot about the high calibre of yoga instructors here.

My current home gym is Brooklyn Boulders in Somerville, MA, but I was in San Mateo for a weekend so stopped by PG for an afternoon. I think PG's bouldering is better than Brooklyn Boulders (BKB), it feels like the problems are more idiomatic and interesting, rather than being short versions of top-rope climbs. It has more natural \"rock\" feel walls (BKB has an interesting wood laminate), more surface crevices and corners, meaning potential stemming and fun techniques like that (little potential to practice stemming at BKB); and most of the problems go to the top of the wall; none do on the main wall at BKB.These walls are also super dense and filled with so many problems, which is good and bad. Good if you have the wall to yourself, but bad if it's at all crowded because so many problems are blocked. It's also the first time that I noticed holds from other routes getting in the way of your climb. (But that's not necessarily a bad thing, it's perhaps more \"natural\"?)They also had more interesting holds types. My favorite were these shallow jug-types that felt secure, but were too shallow to grip past the first knuckle. I felt that this is good training for different parts of the grip. They also had a very interesting green cylinder type hold, that I felt forced you to do monkey-bar style climbing, which was fun.Great staff and impressively stocked retail area.

The equipment is limited in number and is shoved into a small room, making it difficult for more than a few people to use the weights at once.

There are only two bouldering sections, basically little alcoves on opposite ends of the gym. BARELY any space. If you've been to PG SF or Sunnyvale, Belmont is like a quarter of the size. There's no breathing room. And since it's so tiny, it reeks. It just smells like a stinky climbing gym ya know. And the women's locker room isn't any better. The facility seems very outdated. There is gym equipment upstairs though, overlooking the rest of the climbing walls. Maybe they get better ventilation up there from being purely higher up than all the clogged, smelly air downstairs.I was bouldering the day I went there and it started to get pretty busy around 7ish so I left.

It's a class that meets 4 times, and by the end of it I was feeling very comfortable doing whatever I wanted. Jesse and Cheyenne, the guys that taught the class, were super awesome. Some of the participants needed more help than others, and they would do whatever it takes to be helpful. Others needed a challenge, so Jesse and Cheyenne came up with the (fun) drills and harder climbs. They answered all of the questions we had, and Cheyenne even spent extra 15 minutes after the class (it ends at 9PM!!) belaying and cheering me up while I was finishing a tricky route.I live between their Sunnyvale and Belmont locations, which sort of gives me the freedom to choose between them every time I go climbing. And, even though there are more space and more routes in Sunnyvale, I prefer the Belmont location, as the staff here is so much more friendly and helpful and I truly appreciate it. They will teach you, advise you, challenge you and help you every time you need it. I also tend to bring all of my friends that want to try climbing here instead of other locations even if those are closer.As for the gym part, the machines are very simple, but there are some fun additions, like the rings and the boards.

If you pass, you get a permanent pass and never have to take the class again. Also, you get a special deal at the end where it is 5 passes for $55 that is only redeemable that day you take the class. Classes are usually $20 a person so if you are into it, then you should buy it unless you get membership. The class was very thorough and lasted for over half an hour. I can imagine that it would take longer if the class was bigger but since it was only three, it was ok. I kept messing up on tying those friggin knots and I felt like I was in college again cramming right before the exam when I had to show my knots, phrases, and security checks. Dat pressure. I just wanted to climb already but the safety is important. Once you go over the actions for the climber and the belayer, then off you go to explore.It was fairly empty around 2pm but it got pretty popping closer to 3-4pm. There were classes or tours for little children so it became a zoo. So many yuppies do rock climbing and I can only imagine what the Sunnyvale and SF locations are like. You can see there are so many legit people with their chalk and shoes and it is quite intimidating but oh well. It is all about the experience and reaching the top. The routes are marked depending on difficulty. I think the easiest is 5.6 that you practice on and the hardest I saw was 5.13. The most I did was 5.9 haha. I cant help that I am short with no reach or upper body strength. Prepare yourself because your arms will hurt during and definitely the next day as I type this. You see people climbing up like spider monkeys but just take your time and if you fall, you hopefully have your partner to catch you. When you go back down, you just gotta let go and trust. It's definitely hard to let go but Frozen it up. I didnt push against the wall as I went down but I would do that or else you derp and twirl around. There are also shorter walls where you dont have a harness and a complete gym upstairs. If you are into climbing like these hardcore people, I guess this is the best option since it has your walls and a really nice gym. Go with at least one person but you wont be able to race them because one has to hold you. It is fun to go with a group of four maybe because you can cheer each other on. You dont need to bring sneakers since they provide it with your pass I think. I got the one with the class and it included everything so I think the $20 for a regular day would include equipment. Wear workout clothes like tights and a shirt since people may see up your shorts haha. The people here are really dedicated to the sport so I wouldnt worry about that actually. You will sweat as you climb and trying to reach for those things. Girls, dont forget that hair tie because it could potentially get stuck in the ropes or what not.

Conclusion, I am very bad at it. That's not to say I can't climb. I can climb. Despite my small, unassuming frame... I'm quite quick and agile. The height of the climb wasn't really an issue either. Truthfully, I thought the height was exciting. I suck at it because apparently, I am really bad at multi-tasking. Who knew? We started with the belay lesson. Our instructor was great. I think his name was Brandon? Anyway, we found him to be fun and informative. He went over different types of knots that we would be using. Figure eight, double figure eight, double fisherman's knot, etc. I soon discovered that there's more to climbing than just climbing. Many steps to memorize and be proficient at.You must be able to:- attach the belay device- complete a safety check for the belayer (check harness, check that you are clipped into your harness, check that the carabiner is locked, check that the belay device is fed and configured properly)- tie in with a double figure eight knot, followed by a double fisherman's knot- do a safety check on the climber (check harness, check where the rope is tied into, check figure eight knot, check double fisherman's knot)- demonstrate correct communication (climber says, \"on belay.\" belayer says, \"belay on.\" climber says, \"climbing.\" belayer says, \"climb on.\")- demonstrate correct belay techniqueI went first. I got all the way to the top without incident. Rang the bell to signal success. Then suddenly realized, I had no idea how to come down. So, I call down to my instructor, \"Okay, now what?\" Probably something I should have inquired about prior to. He responded with something like, \"Just sit back as if you are in a seated position. Grab the rope with two hands and let your partner do the rest.\" Easy enough, if you aren't a control freak like I am. Needless to say, my partner came through for me. \u00a0Now it was the bf's turn. No fair. He'd been rock climbing before, so some of what we were expected to know, he'd already practiced. He too reached the top without incident. I then suddenly had a thought. Oh, s**t! Is the obvious difference ie; his height/weight ratio to mine going to be a problem?! He's 6' 5\". I'm 5' 1\". He clearly significantly outweighs me. What's going to happen when I release the brake?! I turn to my instructor with my concerns. He assures me I should be fine. I release the brake... and... F**K! The weight of my partner starts to pull me!!! I calmly blurt out a few profanities while informing my instructor of what is taking place. He quickly grabs ahold of the rope and we (together) safely lower my partner to the ground. What I learned from my 1st climbing experience:- I love to rock climb- I could benefit from much more additional instruction- I am not-so great with the multi-tasking- Watermelon weights (they aren't REALLY watermelons, but instead weights that you attach to your harness to keep you grounded) are a must for petite climbers like myself who climb with larger partnersPlanet Granite is a great place to climb, especially in the mornings. Perfectly set routes for all levels. Tons of routes to figure out. You could climb non-stop for hours and never even come close to trying everything in your level. And... if the dates on the cards are any indication, the routes change quite frequently. Enough to challenge the most experienced climbers.The front desk staff members were all very friendly and attentive. I'll likely be back, as I'm considering taking the B.R.C. course... if they ever offer it on a Monday or a Tuesday (my days off). For now, the course is only offered Wednesdays from 7-9pm.

STAFFThe staff at PG Belmont are also well-knowledged in climbing, nice, approachable, and helpful. \u00a0In general, all of the climbers at the gym are quite nice, a bit of an older crowd than Sunnyvale, regulars and willing to help if needed.PG Sunnyvale is larger, but much busier - one night I couldn't even find a free rope! \u00a0And another night it was so crowded that the body funk forced me out. \u00a0More open bouldering (so people are watching - not great for a beginner).PG Belmont is super quiet/empty in the morning/daytime, but fills up a bit more in the evenings.", "date": "3/14/2011"}, {"review_id": "V0c6J8exL2PSVZdPc0YATA", "user_id": "XDgKe98qTvxuHNuwUVLwNA", "user_name": "Ron S.", "business_id": "OJ1Pd42-T1oFIm2sqvy_hA", "stars": 5, "useful": 0, "funny": 1, "cool": 0, "text": "If you like to get high, this is the place for you (as long as you can drag your ass up the big walls and not fall down). \u00a0You should also get rid of that spare tire, which you can do at Planet Granite before or while you are working to concur the various top down walls and two (yes two) separate bouldering rooms. \u00a0What that mean is when an asshole brings his 4 year old that plays consistently on the bouldering mats, you can go to the other room (before you do, say hi because that asshole is me).Planet Granite has a grigri setup for you at every top down climbing route, so you can leave your ATC at home (or carry is around for no reason, like me [the asshole]). \u00a0The routes vary nicely, from a almost vertical 5.2 to several extra tall LEAD routes. \u00a0As I said earlier, I take my son with me and PG supplies good quality shoes and harnesses for all ages.Best part, if you have your belay lesson at PG you get a 1/2 off day pass.", "date": "9/29/2008"}, {"review_id": "8aF7cAxy7HPbqlWtor592g", "user_id": "c9MOCO73ZRrFClBLzRf0Jw", "user_name": "Tiffany L.", "business_id": "OJ1Pd42-T1oFIm2sqvy_hA", "stars": 4, "useful": 1, "funny": 1, "cool": 1, "text": "I was never a big fan of any gym especially given the close quarter/smell.

Belmont just happened to be the lesser of the two. Belmont is closer to me so I didn't mind getting the crappier gym. Then they opened up their San Francisco location. And now it's way too obvious that Belmont gym members are getting the huge shaft. It ticks me off sometimes when I think that we are paying the same monthly rate as San Francisco and Sunnyvale gym members and not getting the same quality facility that they get. Slowly I have seen regulars in Belmont make the trek out to the south bay or the city eventhough Belmont is their closest gym. I don't uderstand how management could let this place deteriorate when it's in one of the most affluent areas in the bay. Can you picture a really old crappy gym in the heart of Beverly Hills or Orange County? Thats what this place is!But let me give you specifics because you guys have no clue of the things that I am complaining about.Weights: The main weight room has a slanted floor! So if u were to put a dumbell on the ground it would start to roll. GHETTO! The machine weights feel dated as well as the cardio equipment. Picture your local 24 hour fitness equipment and think about the equipment they threw away when they upgraded to new stuff. I have this theory that belmont just raided the 24hr fitness garbage can and stole all the old stuff that wasn't up to 24hr fitness standards. But its good enough for Belmont Plant granite I guess. they have this open weight room area that would be pefect for jump rope, lunges, or any other plymetric excercices that require lots of space. Too bad the floor isnt sound proofed and its right underneath the yoga room so any of those are out of the question.Bouldering: Small!!! The only bright side is that they have 2 caves. 1 cave has a larger concentration of V0s and V1s. The other cave has the harder problems and no one under 14 pears or age is allowed in. I like this seperation especially since the weekends have a lot of kids dangeroursly running around the place. But no highball bouldering or top out boulders that the other gyms offer.Roped Climbing: Small!!!! Sunnyvale and San Francisco both have lead climb only sections. Not Belmont. Since the bouldering and top roping are so small, this place gets old real quick! Think abou this. If they are refreshing the problems and routes in Belmont at the same rate as Sunnyvale and San Francisco. Then we are getting far less climbs overall. Their size is 2x as big. Y do we have the same refresh rate as them? 4 or 5 Bouldering Sessions and you're probably done with the amount of projects you can do. But you can be in San Fracnisco and still not finish all your potential projects when they redo the probelms.Yoga: If you're joining the gym just for Yoga purposes then you wouldnt notice a difference in quality. Each gym has different teachers and classes so its all different and a matter of preference. I do know some people that drive all the way to the city for Sarah's Mon and Wed vinyasa flow. And remember, the ceiling is thin so your yoga expereince could get distracted by the sound of people WORKING OUT IN THE WIEGHT ROOM! How dare they!Locker facilites: Homeless people live in more sanitary environments than this. This is the place where SARS was born. Plumbing is always an issue week in and week out. Small lockers so you cant fit an entire wardorbe without wrinkling it. How would you go to this gym before going to work? Filthiest Suana I have seen in my life. The light inside doesnt work which is probably a good thing so you wouldnt notice the true disgustingness of it. To many members doing naked bikram yoga in their. It does get hotter than the saunas in San Francisco which I like. But I think it gets so hot because its busted. The wall clock which was outside the suana room door is broken and hasnt been replaced in 2 weeks. You can buy one in walgreens for 2 bucks! I know, I've purchased one.Staff: OK so the staff is the only bright spot.

To do anything there you need to take a belaying class (I think it's $17). But belaying is only using the pulley attached to your harness to lower someone, and keep the rope taut as your climber climbs. The actual climbing is learned by doing. My advice, watch the girls, they have a tendency to use thier legs, men tend to try to muscle everything around. That and trust your equipment, if you do, how high, how hard, doesn't really matter. The rope you use has a tensile strength to hold 4000lbs, so it could hold a \u00a0Jeep Grand Cherokee in the air. It's pricey (I pay $70 a month), but it's $20 to climb if you're not a member, and another $5 for gear. If you go 3 times, you might as well join.

The sport routes here are pretty good under the lead cave and the only real problem i have is that they set routes that traverse the whole wall and climbers leading those routes end up taking up the whole wall. I know they restrict those routes during peak times but even off those times it gets really annoying. The ratings here are on the easy side and some times the consistency is off. There would be a 11a that would be incredibly technical and difficult and a 11- that would be like a walk in the park almost. Last thing about the lead climbing is that the lead test i think is to easy at this gym so there are a lot of people who shouldn't be lead climbing here. I think the minimum requirement for the lead test is to climb a 5.8 which is ridiculous. The bouldering is ok here. If you're really into bouldering go to the newer gym in Sunnyvale. The walls are much more \"boulder\" like. The exercise equipment is great at this gym, only thing is it gets crowded at the peak hours from 6-9pm.
