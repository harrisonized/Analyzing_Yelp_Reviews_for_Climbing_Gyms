Because he showed me how to secure the rope onto my harness, I asked them to test me again and they said I couldn't because I failed the first time. \u00a0I really wanted the girls to experience the buddy belay because they were having a hard time with the auto belay also.I have done this TWICE before. \u00a0Each times two hours each, I just couldn't remember the \"8\" tie in of the climber and if they could gone over with me it would have not been a problem. \u00a0And fine, let's say for liabilty reasons they aren't allowed to teach you anymore, but if I got taught by someone else and I knew the material later, why am I not allowed to get tested again? I only needed a recap. \u00a0This wasn't new material for me to master. I swear, Hangar 18's new management and their rules are so full of crap. \u00a0It is definitely not recommended for beginners. \u00a0Back in the day the whole right wall was filled with colorful grips to practice for beginners but now more than half of the rocks were missing.If they are doing so well with advance climbers, they shouldn't advertise this place for beginners. \u00a0O and the stingy business won't even let you dip your hand into chalk. \u00a0If this was an all included package for beginners, shouldn't that be included as well?I can guarantee you that if we could have done the buddy system, the girls would have had more fun. \u00a0I can say this because I am terrified of heights but I could climb to the top with the buddy system. \u00a0Literally out of four of us, only one could do the auto belay. \u00a0And one can climb so many times on the short walls that doesn't require the harness... I definitely wouldn't recommend this place for indoor rock climbing. \u00a0And although I only came like once a year, never would I step foot into this place. \u00a0Management is rude, bathrooms are dirty, not friendly for beginners, and it smells. \u00a0What a waste of money and a beautiful Saturday", "date": "4/6/2019"}, {"review_id": "gQeQGs0sdgW3daK8cxOZIw", "user_id": "pnx8sqH9dsfj3kUCQg92pA", "user_name": "Michelle W.", "business_id": "MwSipWpc6RHImWWVzncMYA", "stars": 3, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "They have more climbing walls when compared to the LB location, but the customer service here is seriously lacking.

If you're coming from the 405, it's 1-2 plazas after the el Pollo Loco/shopping plaza. I came here with a group of 9 people (we had reservations) and we were all very new to rock climbing. They had two instructors for our group (Kevin and I think her name was kelly... I didn't catch her name bc I went to my car to put my stuff away. I feel bad bc she remembered everyone's name in our group) and they were so nice and supportive! They made rock climbing a lot less scary and helped us on our way up. They also kinda pushed us to try new walls and stuff which was fun. We all got rocked the next day bc we don't do any physical activity haha. We came on a Saturday afternoon and idk if it was considered busy or not. But there were a lot of people that had their own gear and whatnot. I think we were the only group that was new to rock climbing. Everyone else here was clearly experienced haha. Just be careful where you walk bc there can be people jumping from the top and stuff (one of their rules is to always look up). There was also a small group of kids having a birthday party. There's bathrooms in the back which also has a shower in it which is convenient for those who want to take a shower right away after. There is chalk everywhere so expect to get some on your clothes.

And that's just what I did. As a little kid, I was TERRIFIED of rock climbing walls. You couldn't pay me enough to get on one. But I really wanted to try something new, so I decided to check out Hangar 18!!I got a Groupon for an intro lesson and a day pass. Rental gear was included (shoes and harness). I walked in and told the guy at the front desk that it was my first time. He had me fill out a waiver and look through a checklist. After that, he gave me a pair of climbing shoes and a harness and started the lesson. The guy who was helping me kinda seemed half preoccupied and kept leaving to take a call...maybe it was super important idk. But he was kind and patient when I kept falling LOLI went alone, so I wasn't able to take the belay class, but I did get to try autobelay climbing (climbing with a device that controls your fall/helps you with your descent, as opposed to doing this using another person) and some bouldering (climbing with no harness, shorter routes)! They have quite a few routes, so whether you're a total beginner or you have experience climbing, they're sure to have something for you! They have four autobelaysI have absolutely zero experience climbing. Like none. And I possess no upper body strength...so it was pretty challenging!! But this seems like a really amazing workout and a great community!! If you're in the area and don't want to go to laser tag or Gable House or walk around Del Amo or eat anymore (because that's what we do 99% of the time when we hang out in the South Bay), definitely check this place out!! I'd really like to come back with a friend to take the belay classBottom line: It's located towards the back of an area with a bunch of warehouse buildings. There's plenty of parking!! If you decide that this is up your alley, you can upgrade your lesson/day pass to a membership! They had a promo going on which gave you your first month for an additional $5--pretty rad!! You also get a guest pass if you do this. I almost signed up for the membership, but I'm not going to be in the South Bay for the rest of the month, so I decided against it...but I really did enjoy my climbing experience!!

The routes are usually maintained for long enough to give you sufficient time to master them. The climbing culture at Hangar is great. They even offer some classes to help you get into outdoor and lead climbing. Location: Hangar is located on the southern side of Rosecrans, just east of the Home Depot, Michael's and Ross Dress for Less shopping complex. Hangar is a little difficult to find as you cannot see it from Rosecrans. Keep your eyes peeled for the small sign you can see from the road. Hangar is towards the rear of a warehouse complex - the buildings have a light blue trim. \u00a0Proceed through the complex and make a left to the end and you will see the Hangar 18 sign on the building. When to Go: It is better to avoid Hangar 18 on the weekends. It is overrun by children and people that have never climbed before/infrequent climbers. Thus, it can be quite dangerous to climb around these people who don't know or follow proper climbing etiquette. Bathrooms/Changing Rooms: There are two ladies stalls and one handicap shower. There are 4 lockers in the ladies room- bring your own lock. There are also 5 or so cubbies to place your belongings in the changing room. While small, the bathroom/changing room does the trick just fine. Of course there is also a men's room.Weights: There are free weights at Hangar in the back corner by the ladies room. While this free weight corner does not match that of Equinox, it certainly is sufficient and offers a great bang for your buck for a climbing gym.

Coming from the 405 S freeway going N bound it'll be to your right side. However you can hardly see the Hangar 18 on this list of different companies when you enter in. It is pretty hidden and it'll be to your left side once you turn in right to the area. There's plenty of parking so that's a plus. It's pretty obvious you're by a climbing in the evening when you see a ton of cars parked and only one building that seems to be open. In comparison to Hangar LB, this one is much better IMO. There's a large variety of routes and problems and the sets are done a lot better here in this location. But again, this is just in my perspective.However one huge downside is how tight this entire gym was designed. It was not thoroughly thought through because bouldering and top roping are SUPER tight and close together. It's very easy for someone who is being lowered or coming down from the auto belay to accidentally kick someone who is standing by the bouldering walls. When it's crowded it can get really squished and tight and makes it difficult to want to climb because everyone is such close quarters. Some sides are a bit better than others. The sport climbing cave is pretty open and so is the overhung area for bouldering. Their grades for sport climbing are a bit different. Sometimes it's seemingly soft but there's one or two moves sometimes that are tricky and many times they could add an extra foot chip or a hand hold for shorter people.", "date": "1/26/2017"}, {"review_id": "CoWmR_yj7KItYl0PKIJhjw", "user_id": "op8d9geoz8oeBseVAqiPNg", "user_name": "Veronica Y.", "business_id": "MwSipWpc6RHImWWVzncMYA", "stars": 5, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Context: I don't exercise, I'm not very strong, and people can easily make more progress in one month than I can in a year. I was at Hangar 18 for about a year before I moved out of town. I've climbed at Sender One and Cliffs of Id, but this will always be my 'home' gym. I mostly boulder, but top rope or autobelay (there are about 4 of them) when I get tired. Space: This is an old school climbing gym -- the walls look like rocks, and the routes are set really densely together. That means that there are plenty of routes to climb, despite the relatively smaller size of the gym. I just moved to Austin and the newer climbing gym here jus doesn't have enough routes of each ability level. The routes: I've always had plenty to enjoy and to work on -- it never gets boring -- and then by the time I've gotten most of the ones that I am capable of, they change the routes up. Grading seems to be harder than at Cliffs of Id. The routes don't go up nearly as high as Cliffs or Sender One, but to make up for that, the routes are slightly trickier/more technique-y, and IMO, more fun. The only thing that I don't get here that I get at the other climbing gyms are the high top ropes -- there is a certain endurance that doesn't get tried here at Hangar as much. As for the variety of boulder types, they just started putting in volumes and introducing some more balance-y ones (in addition to the slab ones, the overhang-y ones, the dynos and the cave-y ones that they had already). So, as of recently, the boulder problems have become much more varied. The people: This is probably the best thing about the gym. This is BY FAR the friendliest gym I've ever encountered (I've now tried out 5 different gyms -- 3 in LA and 2 in Austin). Some people complain about it being crowded (especially after work on Mondays thru Thursdays). But this is precisely when I come and why I come. I never find that I really have to wait long to climb the route I want to climb (cos hey, we all need breaks), and the dense nature of the routes means that there are always people better and worse than you working on something in that same patch of wall. Everyone is SUPER supportive, cheering each other on regardless of ability level. There's always someone working on the same problem as me, and always someone better willing to give me tips to make me a better climber. Cost: $36/month, but see if you can catch their 3 months for $79 deal -- it happens several times a year, usually around holidays. SO worth it, especially compared to the price of other gyms ($60-$80+/mo). Parking: Easy. Large space. The other locations: One thing that is nice is that there are several Hangar 18 locations and membership in one gets you into all the others. Tip: There's a Monday/Wednesday crowd and a Tuesday/Thursday crowd. There's barely any overlap between the two sets of people. Pick a pair of days, start coming regularly, make lots of friends, and get fit.Ps - I love sender one and cliffs of id; they are objectively awesome, with much nicer facilities.

The people that work here are efficient and friendly enough, but don't expect to have in depth conversations. It's usually pretty busy and they have to keep helping customers as they file in. The belay device they use has it's own anti-locking mechanism which makes it less intimidating to belay here. It makes this gym more family friendly and crowded with more beginners and occasional climbers. There's a platform built up on top of the bouldering areas that they use for birthday parties. If there isn't one going on then it's pretty fun to go up there to rest and just check out the place. The other bouldering area in back you can climb onto also and walk around. Yep the gym is stinky and it's seriously a funk that you'll find at every rock gym. Everything always is covered in a fine layer of chalk because every climber uses it so much. I wouldn't mind if they cleaned up a bit more but I deal. At least here they keep the large garage style door open and fresh air wafts in. Usually it's warm inside but it can be pretty chilly on cold mornings with that huge door open.All in all I have a pretty good time here and get a good workout. It gets pretty crowded in here though and it can be pretty crazy. Since there's more families and beginners here you'll also see a lot of people climbing where they shouldn't be or not paying attention and walking under a climber. Just gotta be more careful coming here during busy times!", "date": "1/19/2015"}, {"review_id": "NS7E6mhUOOiq0Xw0hN-Fyg", "user_id": "JYw4OmQhq33CijEojhK72A", "user_name": "Connie H.", "business_id": "MwSipWpc6RHImWWVzncMYA", "stars": 4, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "I'm entirely new to the rock climbing world and has only been to this rock climbing gym. However, in the time that I've been here, I have needed the newb course in belaying, and a refresher course after not going for a month+. Our first instructor was indifference and was just happy to be over with the lesson. Our second instructor though, Andre, was AWESOME! Although we were just piggybacking off of another lesson since it was meant to be a refresher for us, it became apparent for all of us that we really did forget everything. He was thorough and patience (despite the busy-ness at that time). After our lesson, my sister was belaying for me, and when it was time for me to rappel down, I didn't feel confident in her abilities since her hands didn't seem to be in the right positions. I stayed on the wall for a bit waiting for her to figure it out, when Andre came to the rescue! A+ for attentiveness! As for the facilities, I personally am satisfied. There are rock climbing with, I think, 3 or 4 auto-belay systems in place, bouldering, and a small area with weight machines (although these guys look dated and very sad). It does get crowded at times, but there are also times in which it's quite empty (my favorite time to be there).", "date": "9/1/2015"}, {"review_id": "1aUuW-EsCXK7dY5yRj3Y6Q", "user_id": "i-EFUjCE0oLKoSKcASYIHQ", "user_name": "John M.", "business_id": "MwSipWpc6RHImWWVzncMYA", "stars": 5, "useful": 5, "funny": 1, "cool": 1, "text": "If you're looking for an indoor climbing gym in Los Angeles, I cannot recommend Hanger 18 enough! \u00a0The staff is nice, the people that climb there are generally friendly, they change the routes often enough to keep climbers challenged and their prices are half of what anyone else is charging.The biggest reason I recommend them is because they stand behind their members - 100%. \u00a0Some friends and I had an issue where we weren't given what we'd initially singed up for... and we were rightfully disappointed. \u00a0However, once I shared my experience, Dave (Hanger 18's COO) reached out to me personally to right the situation. \u00a0It's great knowing you are doing business with a company who will stand behind their products and services! \u00a0Hanger 18 is where it's at!", "date": "2/8/2016"}, {"review_id": "EoZuiqORRoavIZ7roBqi4Q", "user_id": "4kBgES1l-l1hIXBNlxB-kQ", "user_name": "Lexi M.", "business_id": "MwSipWpc6RHImWWVzncMYA", "stars": 5, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "text": "So much fun, and the staff is great and really helpful!

Nifty use of technology to cut down on storage while saving some trees. \u00a0Great indoor climbing gym, I live near ARC but see tons of variety in routes here. The middle islands are golden for bouldering practice! Really fun way to mix up your work out, as you'll be using muscles you don't normally use. For example gripping tiny nubs with your fingers, will make you cry out pathetically as you attempt to open a Gatorade bottle at the end of your session!This gym does show concern for safety and covers it's assets well with paperwork. The entire floor is cushioned with additional soft mats you can drag around to break your fall, so I never really had a fear for my life moment at the times where I lost my grip and just had to bail. I didn't use the auto-belay tool but thought that was a nifty option. I have heard complaints from \"real\" climbers that all the mats and safety equipment just trains people to have poor habits, because in the real world there are no mats and to know your limitations.... yada yada. A gym is a gym, running on a treadmill isn't going to be like running on the real world, so as long as you have your expectations in check I think this is good starting place. Recommend you going with experienced buddies not only for safety, but to save time and they can show you the ropes... erm rocks... that are best suited for your level saving time. If you climb enough, I would invest in your own shoes as the ones here look like they have seen better days. Plenty of parking, but the site is easy to miss since it's not visible from the street.

The space is not huge, but on a not too crowded night, beginners to season regulars all seem to find a place to climb.If you're new to this.. a few words of advice:-the place smells a bit funky. After learning about the climbing shoes you'll know why. You won't notice after a while-make sure you read the tags attached to certain rocks and follow the colors and codes accordingly. For beginners look for patterns marked with VB or V0. -If you get stuck, don't be afraid to fall (but fall with caution of course). The floors are super padded and have a bouncing quality to ease the fall. There are also extra pads to break your fall. -Watch out for climbers before you walk under a walkway etc, you don't want to break their fall.-Be courteous and don't climb a wall that someone else is on.-no gear? no worries, they'll have all the items for you. A note, the shoes are shared amongst all visitors. Although they spray it with disinfectants, if youre a big germaphob, you might want to invest in your own pair if you plan to come often.-expect to be sore the next day and don't expect to be as graceful and strong as the veterans, it's okay. They've been working on this for a while.-if your friends have chalk, as them for some. It'll make you nervous palms a little less sweaty and have a firmer grip. :) Overall a very nice experience.

Many of the holds are slippery making it difficult to complete a simple V1 or V0 route. In addition, it seems as though the setters were very careless when setting some of these routes. I saw a lot of routes using red holds placed right next to routes using pink/red holds. It gets difficult to differentiate between where a route starts and where it ends. Also, the difficulty rating did not seem accurate. There were V1s that were easier than V0s and some V0s that had no sense of direction. The facility itself was somewhat clean.

I hate to do this but this gym is UNSAFE. I have been climbing for 15+ years all over the world and never have I felt so unsafe as at hangar 18. The top ropes were not double wrapped at the top so if you are belaying someone heavier than you, if they fall, you will go FLYING. Not to mention that lowering someone off a top rope route means serious burning of your hands even with the required gri gri. I fell once and my partner was sent flying, and I slammed hard right onto my elbow from about 6 feet (normal top ropes shouldn't drop more than 3 feet or UNLESS you're lead climbing which is a whole different beast altogether). This is unacceptable and totally avoidable by double wrapping the top rope for a little more friction. Also, the staff is totally unprepared. The young lady that took care of us was really sweet but definitely sang Disney songs at the top of her lungs for the last 30 mins of our time there (was she trying to get discovered or remind everyone it was almost time to clear out? Her rendition of \"let it go\" got me outta there really fast I'll tell ya). Also, when we were \"tested\" for our belay aptitude a boy no older than 15 came to watch us belay each other. He told my husband he didn't need both the knots as a climber- only one (!!!)After we passed the \"test\" I asked if we needed a certification card and he laughed and said no we don't do that. When I just looked worried and shocked he laughed again and said \"yeah.. we should, but we don't\" and that was that. Meaning do NOT find a top rope partner here at hangar 18 because they will not know what they are doing!On one of the walls there was an open closet jutting out right into 3 of the top rope routes. I tied it closed using another top rope and when one of the staff walked by and we asked him to close it he shrugged and said sorry they lost the key. He left my rope the the way it was and walked away.There were shards of glass in the carpet near the cubby areas and the vending machines.This place is obviously abandoned by whomever owns it, and it is frequented by twenty somethings that either aren't serious about climbing, don't care or don't know any better. Do NOT bring your children here. The climbs do not vary much in difficulty or style even if they are labeled differently so don't expect much there. They are obviously all set up by the same inexperienced climber.Anyway, the gym is cheap, so I guess that's nice. The staff told us people buy groupons indefinitely and never pay the full $50 membership... And it's obvious given the state of the establishment.Climb at your own risk and after they make you sign 10+ pages of liability waivers lol", "date": "8/12/2014"}, {"review_id": "9LkwB08-I-ptK_E9nhPIjw", "user_id": "vURJ8CAMO9Q9Cdm-X0hgkQ", "user_name": "Nina S.", "business_id": "MwSipWpc6RHImWWVzncMYA", "stars": 4, "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Me and my friends went to hangar 18 in Hawthorne yesterday. I have to admit that I did not like it at first because everything looks and was pretty close together, which made me feel uncomfortable. It turned out to be a great gym after spending almost 5 hours there :)The great part about this gym is, that it had padded floors around all climbing spots. We went to the one in long beach 2 week earlier and it only had mats you can pull towards the bouldering spots.Back to Hawthorne. I read previous reviews about the bad service but I can not agree with that! We did have to wait a few minutes but that is normal due to the day of the week ( sunday) we decided to go climbing. We purchased a groupon including a lesson and all rental gear which was a great deal! The instructor we had was very nice and explained everything very well! The great thing about the gym in Hawthorne is that there is a bouldering spot where you can \"top off\" and use a ladder to get down again. It was great to know that you don't have to jump off the top or boulder down. You can simply climb up and walk down!The bathrooms were not very nice though. Even though it had a shower for people who use it as a normal gym, the individual stalls could have been cleaner. The reason why I did not give out 5 stars is because of the bathrooms and that it was extremely crowded around \u00a04pm which made it hard to move around and climb in different spots.Overall it was a great experience, the padded floor and the topping off was definitely worth going there for :)", "date": "4/8/2013"}, {"review_id": "fRXjaIgcF-asNaYoOCs5Jg", "user_id": "dP8O6EFUUtMURC6IDTy1mw", "user_name": "Jay M.", "business_id": "MwSipWpc6RHImWWVzncMYA", "stars": 5, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "I knew I forgot something...well my friend and I got a groupon to come here about 3 weeks ago and it was so fun.

Before going, I purchased a Groupon deal to get belay lessons since my girlfriend has never been before. When we arrived, we were able to check in with the person at the front desk and get our equipment, but he told us to wait for the next available instructor.... that's when it all went downhill.We were told that we could check out the gym and do a little bouldering while we waited. As I was checking out the gym, I noticed that several of the floor pads were ripped and falling apart with pieces of foam scattered everywhere (strike one).My girlfriend and I continued to try a couple of bouldering routes, but we were only able to very few routes that were V-B and V-0, none of which she was able to complete. As we tried to give it a go, we quickly found that these routes were way too difficult for a beginner. In my opinion, their idea of a V-0 should really be a V-2. Their ratings on some of these routes were ridiculous. I was able to complete a V-4 route that \u00a0was easier than a V-2 that I found right next to it. Rating for their routes were way off! (Strike two)After about 30 minutes passed, I saw a couple (who had checked in after us) getting their belay lessons. I was quick to follow up with their staff and was told that someone was about to help us in just a moment... back to bouldering we went. About 20 more minutes went by and we saw a large group of kids come in for a birthday party and get checked in right away and were given their equipment and lessons. We were completely forgotten about because the staff was too busy to handle their customers. (Strike three)We packed up our belongings and told the staff that we were unhappy with the service and that we were leaving. The person working the front desk could have cared less about what we thought and gave the sarcastic response \"Sorry!\"Well, here I am to say \"Sorry\" to you for losing a customer... I will NEVER go to the Hawthorne Hangar 18 again. Good thing they didn't actually redeem my Groupon :) These guys should really learn from the Upland location!

It's a great gym (see my review on that as well) but it is just such a far drive from Torrance and the rest of the South Bay. Came to Hangar 18 since it's about 20-25 minutes from my house. The price is also approximately half of what it costs at Sender. Price and proximity are the two positives; here is why I rated it with two stars:As other people have stated on Yelp, it smells like a stuffy, dank, and sweaty gym from one of the older locker rooms at Torrance High School. It's relatively dark inside and the walls are not very visually appealing. Now I know that may sound a bit stuck-up and un-pure to a climbing enthusiast that sees these walls as realistic but, what can I say, it's just not as inviting and energetic as some other gyms (including the Hangar 18s in the OC).Also as mentioned by other reviewers, the customer service is nothing to be proud of. Fortunately I didn't experience anyone that was rude. All the employees I've interacted with have been quite nice, it's just that the front desk often sits empty for long periods of time and there doesn't seem to be much urgency if you're waiting there.The routes and problems are all pretty tough. I'm all up for a challenge and I am pretty determined to improve at new hobbies but a V0 at other gyms feels like a V2 at Hangar 18. The routes are color-coded to an extent but some still use old pieces of colored tape to mark the holds of a given route. Oftentimes two problems that sit right next to each other will be very similar in color (like faded orange and orangish-red). It's a bit annoying. The problems also intertwine amongst each other quite a bit. Now, I could see someone arguing that this is more realistic to real bouldering and that problems are not laid out all pretty and easy in nature. That is valid but it doesn't matter much; I prefer the design/layout at Sender One. One Yelper very smartly referred to Sender One as the Equinox (a high-end fitness gym in Manhattan Beach) of climbing gyms. The way I see it, although it's double the price and three-times the distance, I spend 2-4 hours at the gym when I climb and so it is worth it to me.Lastly, the place generally feels cramped. Combine that with the fact that there aren't many V0s, V1s, or V2s and that means you're constantly climbing next to much more experienced climbers. This can feel a bit awkward for a beginner. At the end of the day I thought about keeping my membership and still go to Sender One only once a week or so but I decided to just stick with Sender.", "date": "5/6/2015"}, {"review_id": "nwtrgdS2wpF6-wyFko-w5w", "user_id": "Pd6DaG6-73WTLfgqz3TxNA", "user_name": "Trang V.", "business_id": "MwSipWpc6RHImWWVzncMYA", "stars": 4, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Well I started going to the one in upland because my College is right next to it.

However, this was over 3 years ago. Since then I have gone out into the world and seen other gyms. I am sad to say that Hangar 18 is a hot, smelly mess.Issues are as follows:1) Floor - is in utter disrepair. There are various tears in the mats, so if you land in them you risk spraining and shattering your ankle or foot simultaneously. In the past three years I can only recall one section of the mat being replaced. So, just think about this: 3 years of feet and sweaty climbing on these floors.2) Mats - lumpy, flat or so stiff that you can sprain your ankle on them.As of 1/23/13, there are at least 6 VERY LARGE tears in the floor. Walking on them alone is bound to twist ones ankle.3) Ropes - old. I have to use a house gri-gri because my Gri-Gri2 cannot accommodate the ropes once they begin breaking down on the inside (which causes lumps in the rope)4) Routes - slow turnaround.There are some routes in the back wall that have been set for over 6 months now.5) Ventilation - on hot days this place is a sauna. They used to have a fan in the back, but it has long since been broken and no one has tried to fix it.6) Sound system - intermittent in the back of the gym. If anything, this is indicative of how management has not taken the time to make repairs.7) Anchors - the floor used to have rope anchors for pairs of climbers that were composed of one large and one small person. Now we have to vie for the single counter-weight, \"Wally\". \u00a08) Bathroom/Locker rooms - are dusty and the floors are filthy.Pros 1) Staff - very friendly and willing to help in any way possible.2) Climbers - very friendly and willing to help in any way possible.The sole reason I keep coming to this gym are the two Pro-reasons (and why I gave this place 1 star). So, if you don't mind poor climbing conditions, then feel free to come here. But, if you do, you will meet some amazing and talented people.I beseech management to please tend to this Hangar 18 with the same care and consideration that they do their other Hangar 18 gyms.

And new guys, don't get all sullen if the 5' skinny girl can outclimb you. She's just better than you.-There is climbing etiquette. Mostly - Don't hog a route/wall. Pay attention to the people around you. Are any of them working on the same wall? If so, you take turns. When it isn't your turn or you are checking out a route step back so that others can climb.

We both are moderately experienced with rock climbing, so we knew what we were getting into.::SERVICE::Probably the most troubling aspect of the place so I'll get it out of the way first. The staff seemed REALLY tired or bored or ... something. They were more than willing to get us checked in and get some equipment for us but the enthusiasm was lacking. Maybe they were all at a staff meeting the night before, went out to a bar afterwards, and were really hungover.Not sure if this should be included in this section, but for lack of a better place here it is. It's very easy to climb here compared to other gyms. We just had to sign a waiver and that was it. We didn't need to prove we knew how to belay (we do, in case that frightened you) and we pretty much could walk right in and do whatever we wanted without supervision. It was really convenient for us, but if you're inexperienced then you might be left in the lurch.::FACILITY::If you've been to other rock climbing gyms (Planet Granite or the like) this place might surprise you a bit. This place is JUST rock climbing. They have one, and exactly one pull up bar/dips combo machine and a few free weights that are flippantly left in the corner covered in chalk. If you like going to these places to climb but also do other stuff, you'll be let down.The bathrooms have a shower which gets the job done. They're pretty small but clean overall.::THE ROCKS::The impression I got was that everything was old. The colors of the holds were often faded, making it difficult to tell where your next hold was. The routes on the walls would drift into areas of other paths, making it really likely two climbers would get in each others' way. On two occasions a hold moved in my hand, which probably isn't good (but I am a bigger guy, 230 lbs, so it may not be relevant). The difficulty ratings of the courses seemed a bit off as well. Routes ranked very easy would be rather challenging while others ranked a bit harder were a cinch.The bouldering is definitely the best part of the gym. The routes are fun and dynamic and there are a ton of them. If you're big on bouldering you'll like this place a lot.Overall we DID have a good time here, but this does not strike me as a place to go if it's your first time as there isn't much in the way of coddling.

That being said, over the last year the user experience has been on the decline.There is no education provided to new climbers. If you don't believe me, go up to someone who is wearing socks under their climbing shoes and ask them if they've been explained climbing rules or etiquette. The gym has become overcrowded with people who don't know the rules. Hangar18 does a Groupon every 3 months and their goal is to get as many people through that door as possible, which I totally understand. The problem is, they do little-nothing to explain the rules to the new clients or educate them about gym etiquette. \u00a0Newcomers are climbing everywhere and most don't even understand the concepts of following routes/problems, which is very important for the safety of others. If you're going to scale up your membership, scale up your staff to accommodate.Just yesterday I watched 5 newcomers coming off the rock uncontrolled, at least 4 times, nearly hitting 3 different experienced climbers who I know to be members for longer than me. The new guys didn't even seem to know or care they were putting others at risk.Kids' parties happen all day long on the weekends, which I also understand. And I also understand those kids can't be reasoned with. But the staff needs to take 15 minutes and explain to the ADULTS that these kids need to be supervised and not playing tag as climbers unpredictable fall to the ground around them. It's dangerous to the kids and the climbers. Recently, there have been injuries, prompting management to draw a cartoon stick figure on a dry erase board, depicting what can happen if people don't 'watch out' or spot each other.

If you have a computer, fill it out on the website before you even show up, saves you about 30 minutes. If you don't do the waivers online before you get there you must sign one off the iPad they have set up to use. After the waiver is finished, a quick explanation of indoor climbing is force fed to you either before or after you fill out an \"Orientation Process.\" The things they explain to you are literally written on this second form you must complete. After those are signed all you will need to do is show up wearing clothes, because they have everything else you will need. They will help you size your shoes or harness pretty quick.

Did you read anything?After you hopefully understand what you are about to do, you are asked:\"What would you like to do?\"Membership is on a month to month cycle and you can cancel at anytime.

The weekends can be decent if you know what boulder problem you want to fall off of again, or already have your friends to climb with. The staff usually is in survival mode again dealing with these parties or individual Group-On users. But these tend to be on the weekends, and so do you! Good luck. At a certain point the size of a group will just make the gym a very loud room to be in.

If you have a day off, and go Mon-Fri anytime before 2pm you have a climbing gym almost to yourself. After work and school the members will mostly come in when the climbing team shows up to practice.

I'm from the North Bay (i.e. San Francisco) and I have to say, we got it WAYYYYY better up north.Hangar 18 is a tiny little rock gym. It is overpriced and fairly dirty. All the mats are worn down, and there isn't much place for them either as everything is very cramped and butted up against each other. In fact, some of the mats were literally torn open and their filling was just all over the place. There isn't a lot of space to walk around without the possibility of someone dropping on top of you. There isn't a lot of seating or cubbies to store your stuff. None of the paths seemed fully finished or properly labeled. I'd read the tape saying to follow yellow rocks with white tape... but there were no yellow rocks with white tape. There didn't seem to be any finish zones either, sometimes the rocks just stopped halfway up with no clear sense of direction. Am I done? Do I dyna up on half these problems? Do i just make my own path?I only went bouldering since I was just myself, but there was some belay action going on, however it didn't look that exciting. Walls were maybe 2 or 3 stories at best? The places I used to go were at least twice as tall as here, and more varied. The bouldering and the belay walls were kept in separate areas where I used to frequent unlike here. Like I said earlier, very cramped, you could probably jump from the bouldering area to the wall if you wanted.The staff was friendly, though I really couldn't tell who was staff and who were just enthusiastic regulars. Maybe I've just been spoiled by the likes of Planet Granite in Sunnyvale and San Francisco, which feel easily 5x larger. But even still, I'd expect more for less. This place needs a complete overhaul, maybe become strictly bouldering and revamp how they label their problems. Drop the day pass price by 5 bucks and maybe I'd consider coming back.If you get a deal, I could see it being okay for a quick fix. Do yourself a favor LA, check out the Planet Granite facilities if you ever travel north, and you will be blown away. Makes Hangar 18 look like a shack. Sorry for all the hate 18, but you just don't scream \"On Belay!\" to me.To those who aren't familar (as I saw these complaints in other reviews), being barefoot and shirtless in a rock climbing gym is very common. Try not to be intimidated by the many lean muscle people displaying their abs and arm muscles, just comes with the territory.

The douchey gym rats and meat heads don't exist here. While there are definitely some people here with great physiques, everyone's willing to help you solve a problem with a climb. H-18 has two big bouldering walls, with the perimeter walls set for rope climbs, which double as great traversing climbs. The membership dues are about the same as a typical gym, the staff is really helpful (but you have to ask for it), and there are plenty of challenges for both the noob and the experienced climber. The gym can get kinda busy at times, just like any gym, so if you hate crowds it's best to go during off-peak hours. H-18 doesn't get five stars from me for a couple reasons: 1) Other than a pull-up bar/leg raise machine and a few weights, there isn't any other gym equipment, not even cardio machines. 2) Unlike some other rock gyms, this one doesn't offer classes for yoga/pilates, etc. (though the location in Riverside does offers these classes). 3) last, but not least, they don't have a water fountain! You'd think an establishment designed to make people exert energy, and thus, be thirsty would have a drinking fountain. Nope. Instead they sell cold bottled water for a couple bucks. Nobody's perfect, I guess.Nonetheless, I'm almost certain I'm going to cancel my 24-hour membership and come here instead.

Drove out to Hanger 18 (still marked as Beach City Rocks on the plaza sign) and was a little skeptical at first. It seems like a lot of large warehouses and storage facilities and it is difficult to tell where the gym is, but just turn right into the plaza and drive to the straight back. Now, I have no basis for comparison, but I think our lesson went fairly well. It was a little intimidating at first, there are all these really fit half naked dudes doing free climbs and running up walls. Yes, I said half naked. That might be your incentive right there. But, Andre was very good about being friendly the entire time, teaching us the four point check, and making sure we were pretty well versed in the process. He had us attempt belay climbing which is SUPER fun because you get to have your friend's life in your hands....and then yours in theirs. Luckily, I trust Grace (my bff) with everything in the world. Andre (who speaks fluent French and is very interesting to talk to while you're taking slack away from your friend) taught us how to climb the wall, take slack, and lower the climber. We tried a couple different walls before my friend said it was time to go to the beach (she's from Austin, Texas...low beach accessibility there). The climb is a total rush. I can see why people get into this -- although you are relying on someone else as your sort of buffer, the climb is really all up to you and your endurance. Once you get past the heights thing (which is only somewhat scary) the ability to push yourself up and trust in your abilities is where the real adrenaline comes from. Grace often had to tell me to slow down because I was moving too fast for a little bit there. I just got super excited! I have no idea if I would be capable of doing this either long term or outdoors (where there aren't any pretty rock colors to tell you where you to go!), but I think I would definitely try this again.

The routes seemed a bit skewed towards routes favoring those with superior upper body strength; there were far more big hand holds/handles than good foot/toe holds on most routes, even going up to 5.10+. Most climbs we saw were 5.8-5.11, but I heard one member of staff ask another to put up some 5.5's for the kids there so I'm sure the staff would be happy to accommodate your level if the walls on any particular day were lacking variety in grade.The people who work here are incredibly nice and when we were there, several groups of kids were climbing and all were well behaved and supervised so I'd recommend this to anyone wishing to unload their brood for a morning or afternoon of agility and confidence building. I had to rent gear and could smell the shoes a mile away so definitely bring socks if you are renting and to anyone working there, you might want to invest in the spray they use at the bowling alley.

Not the strongest preparation for a full climbing lesson and day of climbing! But we got a great deal - $30 for 2 adult lessons, equipment, and a day pass - so we headed over early on Saturday morning for an adventure. They started out by giving us our equipment and teaching us how to tie the correct figure-8 knot between our harnesses and the lead ropes. They were very focused on safety, so we had to practice the steps several times before we could move on to the next one. After the knots lesson, we moved over to the wall and learned steps 3 and 4 -- how to connect the second person to the ropes and make sure they were tied in (after all, if you're climbing and start to fall, your partner on the ground should be sure your ropes are tight enough so you don't hit the ground!) During all of this, our instructor was carefully watching us and answering my multiple questions. He was incredibly patient and very informative. I was the first to climb, starting out on one of the ~5.5 ranked climbs (all of the belay climbs are on a range). The instructor stayed with us for our first few climbs, telling me where to look for the next hand or footholds if I ever got stuck. After he felt we were safe enough, we were given free reign of the gym. I'm so glad that we tried this place out -- I had a blast and, despite being quite sore today from using shoulder muscles I haven't in quite a while, I can't wait to go back!

All of the gyms that I've gone to mark their bouldering routes very clearly with colored tape. But this place marks their routes according to the color handhold, which is a really flawed system. The holds are all dirty so color varies. An orange hold, depending on how worn or dirty it is, could be mistaken for a pink or red hold. So while you're bouldering on a route you'll look to find the next hold and have to debate whether that hold over there is orange or pink... then you get lost and frustrated. They also didn't seem to plan out their routes very well and the holds were placed really awkwardly. And there was no indication of where the routes ended. And the biggest flaw of all: they are really restricted with the routes they set because they can only set them using the same color holds. That is SO DUMB! If they just used colored tape to mark routes then they could open up a whole new range of possibilities as far as creating original, fun routes. This place blows, I wish I could get a refund. Anyhoo, I'm going to start climbing at Rockreation instead.", "date": "1/19/2012"}, {"review_id": "ZWUTAw2o5UZcmuHdNRQoww", "user_id": "-QxjKpeYSL5nGUGrsZ9Ifg", "user_name": "Byung K.", "business_id": "MwSipWpc6RHImWWVzncMYA", "stars": 4, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "I am an avid boulderer, climbing shorter but often harder routes with no ropes. I have been to many climbing gyms and at one point I had a membership at both Rockreation and Hangar 18 at the same time. Since Rockreation is the only other gym nearby and I have climbed extensively at both gyms I will be comparing the two.If you are into to bouldering I would recommend Hangar 18 over rockreation. Both have fun interesting routes but Hangar 18's bouldering area is much bigger. Also unlike Rockreation H18 offers boulders that can be topped out. For sport and lead climbing I think Rockreation has a small advantage.H18 also has a systems training wall and Rockreation does not.But Rockreation does have gym equipments(stationary bike and weights) and H18 doesn't have any gym equipments besides a pull up and dip station.H18 also seems to be cheaper than Rockreation. Also unlike Rockreation, H18 does not require a start-up fee or have a cancellation fee for their membership.(Accurate to the best of my knowledge at the time of the review)The staff at H18 is also friendly and helpful.Just remember to bring a water bottle! Unlike Rockreation they do not have a drinking fountain but they do sell water and drinks at the front desk.Both gyms are good in their own way but I personally prefer H18.***I saw one reviewer complaining about the floor condition.

My boyfriend brought me here. He was pretty into rock climbing and wanted to get me into it as well. This was my first time joining a gym, so I was pretty excited. My boyfriend said this place wasn't that great, but I really enjoyed it. They had a bunch of bouldering options, and then around the sides there was belaying options too. I wish there were more auto-belays, because my boyfriend enjoyed bouldering more. It would have been nice to do the auto-belay, but there was only one (maybe two?) auto-belays for beginners. I think there were two, but every time I looked, the second one was closed off for some reason. But the people were nice and signing up and the belay lessons were really easy. It's small, which is something I like. I didn't want anything too daunting for my first climbing gym. If you're just starting out, I recommend this place. But apparently if you've been climbing for a while, you may want to look else-where. Like I said, I liked it. I saw plenty of families taking their kids there, which was cute. Although, don't go Monday nights. There's some sort of kids climbing club and it's a pain because the kids just run up and take routes your about to start and they are just crazy running everywhere. It's a pain.

Its a decent gym with its positives and negatives. I go here because its the closest place and they have a decent membership price if you're a college student. I'm reviewing this from a rock climber's perspective.First, I want to correct a mistake others have mentioned. The routes here are not determined by the color of the holds; they are determined by hold color AND tape color. Its a good idea but poorly executed. The problem is that when they set their routes, they spray paint some of their holds to make sure they are matching colors. This makes some of the holds more slick. Also, the paint on the smaller foot holds will chip and the underlying color will show. A lot of times you don't even know which foot holds to use because of this. Also, because the wall is made of rock and not wood like other gyms, the tape easily comes off. Anyone that climbs here a lot knows tape ALWAYS comes off. Sometimes its not a big deal and you can figure out the route based on hold color, but sometimes they will have 2 separate routes of the same hold color cross each other. When the tape comes off, you don't really know which route that particular hold belongs to.The staff is hit or miss. Some of them seem pretty helpful and nice. Others seem like they are only there because they have to be.Like I said, the wall is made of some kind of fake rock. This is SOOO much better than having wood because the rock has features you can use for your feet. The routes are pretty good, but compared to Rock City which has GREAT routes, most of the climbs seem pretty bland. There are A LOT of climbs with really big moves that seemed like they were made for 6' 2\" climbers. I think most regulars here will agree that the climbs can be really reachy. It can be a bad thing, but then again you start to get really strong.This is a good gym if you're already a decent climber, but could be a bad experience if you're going for the 1st time.", "date": "2/9/2012"}, {"review_id": "XKXRKgfc_lsy2WJo8M1Msw", "user_id": "mJmKHZOSjzqwTww3IFm1Zw", "user_name": "Lauren E.", "business_id": "MwSipWpc6RHImWWVzncMYA", "stars": 4, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "+ the cool spiky-haired woman at the front desk was incredibly helpful. we're fairly new to climbing and it was our first time here, and i liked how she stood around to check each of us on our knots/belaying before going on her merry way, answered all our stupid beginner questions, etc. the gym is big and airy, with enough routes in the 5.7-5.9 category and bouldering to keep me occupied and challenged. they also had a bunch of much harder-looking things, none of which i'm going to be tackling any time soon!came on a sunday afternoon, and there were maybe 15 other people there -- not crowded at all. -- pricewise, $16/day pass is ok but i wouldn't mind it being a couple bucks cheaper!", "date": "8/11/2009"}, {"review_id": "9gi3EQ-mjEHJLfqE5EmDIg", "user_id": "IaKNKMClY7HTU5pC1Ur7bw", "user_name": "J D.", "business_id": "MwSipWpc6RHImWWVzncMYA", "stars": 5, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Was there with a group all ages mostly beginners.
