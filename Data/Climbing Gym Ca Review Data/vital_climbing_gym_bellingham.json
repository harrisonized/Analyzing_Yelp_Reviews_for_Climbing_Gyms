With a bit of hesitation with getting the kids to the top of any obstacle, they quickly got the hang of it and then, we couldn't stop them. The gym wasn't too shabby either. The had a small set of free weights, a couple of yoga/stretch mats, pull up bar, bikes, and a pulley in the downstairs area next to the boulder climbing area. Upstairs was a clean sitting area equipped with a couch, table and chairs (bar stools), and an honor system of a buck or two for coffee and tea. Dogs are welcomed in the lower floor area too! There are cubbies on two walls for storing your personal items. Shoe rentals are available for $2. We appreciated seeing children of various ages on the course as well! \u00a0We are interested in the membership for the family.

Vital fit the bill and I've been impressed with it after a month of regular visits. Though the gym caters solely to bouldering, the setters do a great job of putting up new problems regularly. Problems are pretty thoughtful, too. The community is friendly and welcoming. Vital also has an area of equipment and other goods that's got all the basics you need for general workouts. I also like the specific to climbing training equipment they have -- treadwall, hangboards, etc. 24 hour access for members is also nice! Wish there was an in-house shower and more standard locker rooms so folks could get their sweat on then head directly to work or wherever but hey, that's a small item on the wishlist.

This place is rad and welcoming to all ages and skill levels. By no means am I in shape (yet) but I'm still able to thoroughly enjoy my time and I'm slowly getting better. The top floor of Vital is a well kept, aesthetically pleasing, lounge complete with a coffee and tea bar. The coffee and tea are provided on an honor system and everything is $1, about as easy as it gets. There is a sectioned off lounge area if you'd prefer a quieter environment, such as studying for exams etc. As a student that lives two blocks away downtown, this place is everything I want. As you make your way down the stairs during open hours you're greeted by an employee. If you're new and signing up or a guest to try it out you'll be treated like family. The music is controlled via Pandora and you're able to change the music at any time. Don't be that guy that changes the station every other song, nobody likes that guy. You're also able to connect your own device to play music, say, off your phone. This is great when you're the only one there at 1-2am. As mentioned earlier, mostly everything is a trusted honor system that continues to work because people respect it. You can bring guests when business hours are closed, there is a spot to drop off cash or you can have your account charged. Drinks and snacks are also $1. They have chalk, chalk bags, and t-shirts for purchase too. They have shoe rentals available, I highly recommend them if you do not have climbing shoes.There are many climbing routes to choose from catering to all skill levels. I think they change bits and pieces every week but I'm not entirely sure. There is a slack line for those that are interested, personally I'm probably the worst at it but it's still fun to attempt. There are free weights available, I think a rowing machine, medicine balls, and more to help improve muscles and workout.I could ramble more but I think you get the picture.

They've done a fantastic job starting this gym. \u00a0Members put their picture cards on a board when they visit, which helps people meet each other, and members tend to take responsibility for the place. The latter is emphasized because the gym stays open 24 hrs a day, so the last guy at night should shut off the lights. They have a nice hang-out spot with coffee and Internet upstairs.Also, it is relatively inexpensive to join. As potential minuses - - I think that in general a gym should have showers, or at least a dedicated spot for washing up afterwards, and this gym doesn't. - The gym uses a color code for routes instead of the standard bouldering V-grades. This makes it harder to track one's progress and compare to problems done elsewhere. (Other gyms that have started with the color system have switched over.) At the very least, they could help users make the conversion with a chart and perhaps added notes to each route.- As someone else mentioned, the holds might seem dirty to some users. I'm not bothered by it, but some others might be. Seems like a good washing system between settings might help.
