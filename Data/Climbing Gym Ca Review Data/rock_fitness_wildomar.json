I freaked out when she said to let go! I was terrified but eventually let go. \u00a0After the safety brief we were set to climb. \u00a0 The climbing is the \"easy\" part(it's easier said than done) but coming down Oh my! My first time down I climbed by my second I was moreComfortable and felt like a pro(clearly I am far from it). Needless to say we had a great time learning, encouraging and spending time together!

Even were it not for the heat, the lack of preparation and inability to know when our party was or what we had paid for were nowhere near the \"guided experienced by trained staff and our own \"party room\" we paid for on your website. \u00a0We should not have had to teach the children. \u00a0My party room should not have looked like a storage facility. \u00a0We should have been notified of the extreme conditions without having to call a half hour before our event ourselves.Update: the fact that the owners of the gym voted this review as \"funny\" only proves my point.

Maybe after I get my finances sorted out I can finally be a member here. The first time I stepped foot into this building I was excited and nervous at the same time. I've never been rock climbing before and my fear of heights have always been something that held me back. I nearly backed out of my cousin's invitation to go rock climbing that day but I am so glad that I didn't. They have great prices and discounts for students/military and the pass lasts for 24hours. For first timers, they guide you through the climbing gear and equipment and even have you do a practice climb and fall before they let you wander off on your own. The people that work there are pretty awesome and are easy to approach. They're really chill to talk to and the other climbers are really cool too. You start making friends with the other regulars and get tips and support from them. Honestly a more friendly environment than the guys ogling \u00a0you at EOS fitness. What's cool about this gym is the fact that they have so much to offer. Not only are their prices affordable for a daily pass and worthwhile for a membership, but they also carry climbing gear, have weights, fitness classes, a basketball court, slack line, etc. You could say that they have it all. Also, they're open 24/7. Don't tell me that doesn't have you itching to at least check this place out. They have an area for bouldering and an entire wall filled with so many different paths of varying difficulty. I'm still a novice climber but I've improved so much since the first time I climbed my first 5.5. They change the paths every now and then so you get faced with a challenge of solving a new problem. This is a great place to take your friends for something fun and new to do if they've never been rock climbing and want to try or if you just want to be a little adventurous.

From my couple visits to Rock Fitness I'd say they \"get it.\" 1. Open 24 hours. Just being open till 11 or 12 is rare and while you may not be thinking about climbing at 3am, not having to worry about closing time after a Friday evening session, or when things open on a day off, is great. 2. Solid climbs, variety & styles. To be fair the amount of wall space could be better with a building of this size but it's still bigger than most anything around and very diverse. There's a good range of bouldering with top-outs... top rope, lead, even a bunch of those silly auto belay devices (which are starting to grow on me).3. More than just climbing. If you've been to Mesa Rim in SD or Planet Granite in SF you'll feel right at home... Full weight room, cardio, various fitness classes (never tried any myself) and even a basketball court. Giant slack line and a super-high slackline add some fun high-ropes style diversity too.4. Gear, Food and Free Wifi. It seems like an obvious one but so few do this right and being able to grab a belay device, decent pair of shoes and more than just a candy bar when you're is awesome. Hopefully they'll keep expanding the snack options, maybe even bring in some fresh choices -- with that and free wifi you can definitely hang around.5. Supportive Staff & Community. If you read my other gym reviews I bring this up every time as it's really makes (or breaks a place). The staff actually climbs the gym; setters bring in other thoughts on routes, and people hang around for a long, long time giving beta / tips and just making it interesting to sit around on a long day. For regular climbers (I'm hardly amazing but definitely been to my share of spots) it's a great place to meet others, get some practice in and perhaps pick up a skill or two. For new climbers, groups, whatever, the auto belay setup means you don't have to wait for a special hour to come in and for those looking to do more than a single day, basic belay courses seem to be included.As a nice addition they're really integrated into new technology and give out free rentals to members who check-in, post events through social sites, and so forth.The place is pretty much brand new so there's some things I hope they add in like a set of hangboards (campus section is in progress) and showers. Not deal breakers but it would definitely be a nice addition.Overall the gym is worthy of a full 5 stars considering the other local options and they have the right attitude to get even better.", "date": "4/24/2013"}, {"review_id": "kOUSQpmaOZvcjKeGHYu5oA", "user_id": "cDtT1ARTslBiy2bioYYv0A", "user_name": "Beto C.", "business_id": "Mzb2zyZFFQ1JekYK2kBxCQ", "stars": 5, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Heaven on earth, only bad thing in my opinion is that paying on the 10th of every month can be a lil inconvenient.. but the ppl working are awesome and very helpful. 10/10", "date": "9/1/2017"}, {"review_id": "yW9XqIrT6C7m5r9Konom6Q", "user_id": "JytsMrASTZHKgsS3yNXwVQ", "user_name": "Kayla B.", "business_id": "Mzb2zyZFFQ1JekYK2kBxCQ", "stars": 5, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "This place is so fun!

Safety first :) Visited for a friend's son's birthday. Perfect age group and venue to accommodate all their fun energy. Such a great idea to hold a party in this rock climbing and gym arena. The back wall of the main floor is filled with rock climbing ranging in experience levels, court to play bubble soccer, gym equipment, balance boards, rope climbing, free climbing with crash pads, tight rope walking (girls loved this one in particular) and even a \"slack line\" I believe it was called, an even higher tightrope line, all areas with the proper instruction and safety precautions given verbally. Seemed like traditional gym equipment and non-traditional equipment I haven't come across before. Really fun place. Kids (our group had a toddler with parents accompanying him or course, and other ages from 5yrs to 10yrs). AND adults all had a blast! Their party room was above the gym space in a separate area and it was spacious and bright. I believe Crystal and Hailey were the ones helping and another gentleman, but staff were very attentive. Front lobby has a shop as well, even saw my guy's favorite flip flops available. Rock climbing is an intense workout from my first experience here.

The gym is open 24 hours and I wish all climbing gyms were open 24 hours.However, the cosmic climbing isn't so cosmic; it's basically just dark and there are flashing multi-colored lights. It made it hard to see which routes were which because the darker colored tapes simply all looked black, while the red, orange, and yellow tapes looked similar too. Most people spent their time climbing the more well-lit side of the boulder. It would have just been better to have all the lights on to begin with.===Climbing===Bouldering is mostly on a small/medium-sized central boulder that can be topped out on. You get down using a pole, or easy 'steps' made with jugs. Large bouldering pads must be pulled around boulder, and a sign states that a spotter is necessary for the taller, steeper white part of the boulder.The shorter side of the boulder is easier, but have unlabeled routes. I'm not sure if it's for training or why it's unlabeled. It would help beginners (some of whom were in our group) if they labeled the easier routes, as the easiest labeled route was a 1+. The rest of the boulder has decent, tough, and sometimes interesting routes, both on the slab and the steep sides. Other than the small archway, there isn't a big heavy overhang wall like other gyms. Outside of the main boulder, one small section of the main wall has shorter, smaller problems for kids, but are also good for practicing balance problems. Another section is for practicing dynos.The main wall is about 30ish feet and has several auto-belays and top ropes. There is also a part of the wall for lead climbing, but we didn't do lead at the time. A lot of the routes were unlabeled; I'm not sure why that is. The hardest labeled route was a 5.10b. There were some unlabeled routes that felt about the same or a bit harder, but it's hard for me to judge since I was pretty pumped and at the end of my climbing session. I was pretty underwhelmed with the routes on the main wall; they just didn't feel interesting to me.For climbing training, there's two campus boards, many climbing training boards (like they bought every one on the market and put 'em up), a set of monkey bars, and a few hanging balls and holds to hang onto.===Rest of the gym===The rest of the gym is actually pretty nice and fun to work out on after climbing. There's quite a variety of workout equipment, bike machines, and treadmills, which I didn't use. There's a slack line, full indoor basketball court, trampoline, rope, rings, and several balance boards. There's also a ping pong table upstairs. I'm impressed at the variety of activities outside of climbing.===Overall===Overall, the gym is a good all-around fitness gym, but not so great for purely climbing, as I wasn't too impressed with the climbing space. The bouldering was good, but I wish there was more bouldering to do, and that there were more pads, or it was fully padded. I don't know why a section of the wall was unlabeled. The main top rope wall was underwhelming, not interesting, and also mostly unlabeled. I'd give the actual climbing part 3 to 3.5 Stars. But for those into other gym activities, the gym does well, and I will admit it is great to hit other parts of the gym after climbing to workout. So together the climbing and the rest of the gym, I give it 4 Stars. If I'm in the area, I might drop by, but it's certainly not a place I would make a destination out of for purely climbing.", "date": "3/30/2014"}, {"review_id": "LMzrOT_QOyJzyoy4Eg5unQ", "user_id": "KedNkUktq7HEGeLkNFiUiQ", "user_name": "Justin B.", "business_id": "Mzb2zyZFFQ1JekYK2kBxCQ", "stars": 5, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Awesome time.

One bonus that RF offers is a bevvy of Auto-Belay Devices for top-rope climbing without depending on someone to belay for you. For those that like a more challenging workout, RF has a newly installed campus board and a moon board with over 400 boulder problems in one.Apart from the climbing is access to top notch gym equipment, some group classes and a relaxing area with hammocks and some table games. There's also a basketball/volleyball court and a new trampoline style smash ball court; I haven't tried that yet, but it looks like fun.The staff here has to be mentioned.

There are plenty of routes with a variety of different climbing styles and techniques. Lots of autobelays available but it doesn't seem like the walk-ins get very much instruction on how to use them or understand general gym/climbing safety upon entering the gym (I'll get to this later). However, since the gym is open 24 hours, you're able to come in late when the gym is less crowded and send some awesome routes. As a climber I don't see myself using the weightlifting equipment or bball court anytime soon, but the climbing atmosphere is SOLID. The boulder routes are spot on as well, with a pretty neat fire-pole after the mantle finishes. Also, RockFitness has high hopes in terms of future expansion and I can't wait to see where it ends up. Plans include: hangboards, outdoor walls, 2 slacklines, and more gym equipment. But after talking with some of the staff, plans to increase membership fees may be seen in the near future. Right now, pricing is.... comparable.... to bigger gyms, but if you plan to pay the $15 entrance fee and the $5 for gear rental, make sure you take it easy and just enjoy you're time there. All in all: cool gym but not focused on climbing, only half the gym (right now) is climbing, and the other half is misc work out machines and a bball court. The routes are awesome and it has a great feel.I'm giving it 3 stars because it is a bit pricey on the membership and day pass side for things I wouldn't really use as a climber. Certain staff don't patrol the gym and make sure people are safe and I even asked one of the staff members if I could use my personal ATC and she had no idea what I was talking about. The same staff member walked by a child (8-10 y.o) messing around on the assisted dip/pullup machine and said nothing. Since it is the only top-rope/lead climbing gym in the area, I will be climbing here often, but most likely when it's late. Maybe I'm being a bit harsh, but I'm HUGE on safety.
