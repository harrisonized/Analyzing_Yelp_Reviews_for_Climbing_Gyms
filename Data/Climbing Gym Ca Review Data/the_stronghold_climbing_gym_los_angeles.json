It's HUGE!!! They offer bouldering, top rope, and lead! It's located inside of an old factory and the ceilings are ultra high. This means, the routes are a lot higher than most other gyms I've been to. SO COOL!The staff was extremely professional and kind. I had a lesson with Kevin and he was awesome! I noticed that they offer personal training there and there were approximately 8 trainers with various levels/history of climbing. Rates seemed very fair. Members receive a very large discount vs. non-members. There are a small handful of auto-belay systems on some walls, which I appreciate. You can't always go with a friend so this makes it much easier to be consistent. Also, the gym is DOG FRIENDLY! Whhhhatt?! Yes, that's correct! If you have a well behaved dog, you can bring them with you!!! SO RAD! Oh! There's a sauna and showers in the locker rooms! On the second floor, you'll find a small but mighty gym section with free weights, ropes to climb, power rack, treadmills, Concept 2 rowing machines, rope machine, rice bucket, and some kettlebells. There's also a little yoga studio up there. Across from the gym area was a large section of holds to help increase your climbing skills. The only downside was the lack of parking. It was raining and I had to trek a ways to get to there. Otherwise, I love the area it's in. Tons of cool businesses in the Arts District so you can spend a whole day there if you wanted to!

Climbing is a great team sport, every one plays coach/spotter/cheerleader (gender-non-specific) as well as star. You take turns. You do the damn thing...then do it again.

With climbing you can really see if someone has your back.

I was using everyone's buddy passes for almost 6 months and decided that I was going to consolidate my regular gym and climbing gym into one (it made a lot of sense for my budget). In the past year, they've made a ton of changes and reservations--you can tell that they put a lot heart and thought into this gym and cultivating a certain type of culture.The gym consists of:- Bouldering Routes. There are plenty of routes for beginners. They also do a great job hosting regular free and paid classes to help you get started. I took one on managing the fear of falling and it was very helpful especially since I was coming back from a knee injury. If you top out on the bouldering side, there's a workout area up there with a moon board and other training mechanisms. - Top Rock/Lead Routes. The tallest part of the gym is ~45 feet. There are walls of varying heights which is helpful especially when you're getting started or showing new people around the gym. - Work Out/Gym Area. The second floor has a yoga studio space and a full gym workout area (treadmills, rowers, barbells, kettle bells, bikes). I have plenty of space to both Olympic lift and power lift when it's not that crowded. There is sometimes a wait if you're trying to lift around 4:30/5pm on a weekday but it moves pretty quickly. You can also use the yoga studio space to meditate and stretch when there isn't a class. They've got blocks, straps, mats, etc. if you don't have your own equipment. - Sauna. The most recent addition is the sauna and it smells so DELICIOUS! They also give you free towels now. They also have a shower if you want to save on your water bill.Staff:I've gotten to know the staff at the gym (and their personal music taste). It's an easy place to meet people, doesn't have a corporate feel. Everyone is super friendly (well I guess most climbers are friendly) and loves talking about their climbing passion indoors and outdoors.Tips:- It gets a bit tough to park when it's really busy so you need to park on an adjacent street. It's only 300-500 feet further so it's really not that bad even on the busiest night of the week.- They provide shower, conditioner and body soap in the showers which is clutch especially when you forget to bring some.- The rental climbing shoes aren't the best and the harness isn't very comfortable but that's because they're rentals. I finally caved and bought my gear which is a good thing since they're starting to charge members for rentals.- They have these sweet hammocks that you can lay in and rest in if you're waiting for your friends to get to the gym or you're working from the gym. - There's free coffee and tea before noon every day which I appreciate. You just need to bring your own coffee mug. - Take advantage of the yoga classes because they're geared towards climbers.- Join the Buddy Maker facebook group to find friends and someone to belay you.", "date": "1/22/2018"}, {"review_id": "qGLocX-h3KBMJQi_p_acIw", "user_id": "SkfcgOcMJoDR4zIH5R9h6Q", "user_name": "Mikey M.", "business_id": "8KZ0f0Do0Iq0tKcl4R3pmQ", "stars": 4, "useful": 0, "funny": 1, "cool": 0, "text": "Definitely will make a second visit.

When you enter through the doors, the entire gym is brightly lit & really spacious. At the front, you sign in & sign the obligatory waiver if you haven't online yet. They'll locate it & then you'll be on your way (just make sure not to sign too far before your appointment time & it takes a while for their system to pull up your signed waiver since they'll have a lot in the system).

Cliffs of Id may come close once they get their roped sections up, but for now Stronghold is the reigning king of the area, not to mention 15 minutes closer to the SGV.And I'm not saying this as a new climber who happened upon a Groupon or came to the gym on a lark. I drive in from Pasadena at least twice a week, if not more, to get on the walls here due to the quality of the route setting, the frequency of new problems and routes and the top shelf staff who makes it all gel. As someone who has been climbing for over a decade I feel it important to point out that most of the negative reviews of Stronghold are born of ignorance or stupidity. Two very different things mind you. Simply put, this is an amazing place for new climbers to learn about our craft as well as seasoned pros, both old and young, looking for realistic indoor ratings. In addition to the friendly staff, many of us who climb there regularly are more than willing to spend a session with new climbers, making sure they are safe and understand the risks.... IF said gumbies are willing to listen and rank low on the D-Bag scale. Monthly potlucks, awesome classes, killer gear demos and most importantly, a regular crew of amazing climbers really sets this place apart. When I walk in (even on heavy gravity days) I feel surrounded by family or by friends I've not yet met. This describes the one word key to any high caliber climbing area or gym: community. I personally feel it's something abundant at Stronghold...All of this on top of long roped routes, incredibly creative bouldering, air conditioning and stupid close proximity to Barbara's where one can find post session respite with killer food and drink!?I live less than ten minutes from a climbing gym, yet I choose to brave LA traffic at least twice a week to visit the Stronghold. That alone should tell you something. I've lead for real 5.10c in Joshua Tree, where I've spent no small amount of time, frequented Bishop, Idyllwild, Red Rock, the High Desert, Santa Monica's and even made a few trips to The Ditch.

It's a well-though out compact gym within a climbing gym! There was also a canvas enclosed \"room\", where people were participating in a yoga class. For the bouldering section the routes seemed much easier rated than my go-to gym ARC in Arcadia. This is a plus when bringing friends that are new to climbing. The ability to complete routes, will have friends feeling accomplished and keep the enthusiasm high resulting in a desire for future climbing. You can seriously spend you day just on the bouldering section, the transverse red/black that goes across the entire section was a fun surprise. I am seriously going to come back here with my harness and spend sometime on the ropes. The 46 foot walls just looks glorious. :OCheck-in as a first-timer was a cinch with the mini iPads.

Beginners should do a belay class (~3 hours long), where the staff teaches you about the history of climbing as a sport, safety, and lets you practice climbing. Otherwise, if you've gone climbing before, bring a partner who can belay you or you can rely on the auto-belay. There's only two, but they're usually free cos people bring their friends. There's also bouldering, yoga, and a full weight gym on the second floor.The facility is very clean, although there are faint smells of worn socks, which is expected as everyone is mostly barefoot.

Warren W. mentioned how Stronghold \"doesn't have the belay and lead hooks tied on the ropes\" (I'm going to assume he's referring to autobelays where you don't need a belayer) like other gyms. And then he goes on to complain how the front desk wouldn't let him on and teach him how to tie the rope i under 5 min. That's a big no-no. There's a lot more to tying knots onto your harness than what it seems.You have to learn how to belay, how to tie on knots, learn how to read when your climber is going to fall and catch his fall, etc. And even in that one or two hour class, you still won't be perfect with belaying. If the front desk tells you that it's not a good idea to learn how to tie into a knot, it's for you safety. Belaying is an important skill that one must master and learn, as your climber is trusting his/her life on you.So I would take caution with Warren W.'s review and take the darn belaying class. And I'm speaking with a year's worth of climbing experience and even then I still feel like a newb.AnywayI went with several of my friends to Stronghold for the lead climbing class.It's much cheaper than Sender One's or Boulderdash's lead climbing class. Peter, our teacher, was excellent in covering how to clip in, rope payout, belaying, and learning how to brace the whipper. I'll do say that I wish there was more one-on-one time with student and teacher to observe your lead belaying and clipping in, but that's probably due to the size of the class. I highly recommend the class. I probably should practice some more before we take off the top rope belay.As far as facilities go, their top rope/lead walls are incredible. The walls are 65 foot long or so I've been told. They have three autobelays, plenty of top-rope routes, and a nice little bouldering section. I flashed a 5.10a on one of their autobelays and it was incredible, but man is the climb so pumpy on your forearms. It's a lot harder without belayer.I'll do say that one of the issues I have with the gym is air conditioning control. It's hot as sin if LA is experiencing a hot day. Whatever, it's just me nitpicking.I would recommend this for any climbers of all skill level. Keep in mind that it's a great idea to learn how to belay or take the belay class before coming here.

Contrary to what other reviewers have said, yes it is a 3 hour class and you can stay at the gym until they close from my understanding.

This spot is located in the Brewery Complex near DTLA and houses 50 foot walls, a few auto-belays, great bouldering section, workout machines, and a new moon board training area above the bouldering wall. There's free parking on the avenue right outside the complex (DON'T PARK INSIDE THE GATE AS ALL THAT PARKING IS RESERVED FOR THE VARIOUS TENANTS OF THE COMPLEX). They sell a great variety of fitness snacks for that mid-climbing break time, and some books/mags/gear. If you get lead certified here, they provide the rope!This gym is spacious and the routes are always interesting and challenging, and the walls are super grippy (not to mention sharp, as you'll see by the various bloody remnants of climbers scraping themselves on the wall...) During the summer when it's extra hot in LA, the gym can get a bit steamy especially at the top of the climb where there are skylights and the heat collects, but they do have several large industrial fans to help keep the air circulating. The gym is well-lit and has never seemed too crowded to me. Post-climb, you can grab a beer at the bar that's back in the complex. You exit the gym, turn L around the corner of the gym, and then head through the park on the right hand side, and look for the metal stairwell at the left edge of the building past the little park/parking lot and go up the stairs to the bar. They have a great happy hour and decent beer collection, and some typical bar fare.We easily spend all day climbing here on different routes and still want to go back for more. The tall walls offer great endurance training, especially when you go up and down a few times in a row. I sweat my hardest climbing here. :) Or wait, no, I glow. ;) If you follow them on Instagram they'll know your name and be able to check you in more quickly when you enter, too, if you're lucky.

I love that the climbing gym is in a repurposed brewery. The exposed scaffolding and brick walls are a gorgeous backdrop to the climbing walls and there is a really hipster juxtaposition going on here. It's almost like this climbing facility belongs in the arts district and not Lincoln Heights! With that being said, we came on a Sunday around noon and parking was not difficult. It should be noted that all Stronghold gym members should park on Ave 21, before the gate. Once we entered the gym, we signed a waiver on the iPad minis by the entrance and were charged $20 a person for an all-day pass with $4.00 shoe, harness and chalk bag rentals. We started with the bouldering first and it was a disappointing and underwhelming experience. I've bouldered at ARC in Arcadia, CA before and found their walls to be higher and have significantly more routes. I wish Stronghold had more V0 and VB routes to select from because I did not see too many. From what I observed, it was easy for many people to top-out as the walls aren't too high (around 16 feet). My bf and I also decided to try the auto belays and he loved it! It's awesome that our day passes included the auto belays as this was my first time using one. As more people entered the gym, I noticed a lot of them were belaying. If you're into belaying, then I think Stronghold is an excellent climbing gym for you. There were so many high walls and a variety of difficulty in the routes for belaying! The 2nd floor overlooks all the climbing action and has a small fitness area complete with: a treadmill, a weight section and an area for yoga. This was a welcome escape for my hands and arms as I decided to take a break from the climbing and focus on running for a bit. Bottom line: Since this is a new gym, everything is still brand spankin' new--including the restrooms and lockers! I was amazed at how large and clean the bathrooms were. The lockers in the women's restroom were also self-locking so I felt my belongings were very secure while I climbed. For me, I think I would rate the gym 3 stars overall because of the bouldering walls. For future improvements, I would LOVE to see an expanded bouldering section with higher walls.

I became a member when it first opened and haven't looked back! here are some tips for newcomers:- If you're new to climbing and don't have any experienced friends to take you, definitely get an intro to rock climbing class from groupon. Otherwise you'll only be able to boulder (short walls, no rope) or use the 3 autobelays in the roped area. - If you buy a day pass that includes access to everything in the gym, so you can also try out a yoga or core class to get your money's worth! - Don't hesitate to ask staff members for help or advice. They are awesome! Super nice, caring people. - If you've climbed elsewhere, you still need to take a belay test for top-roping, and lead test for lead climbing but they are pretty straightforward. If you haven't climbed in awhile, ask a staff member to give you a quick review.- Head to Barbara's brewery next door for a post-climb beer and food -Plenty of parking in the long driveway except for weekday nights, when it can get crowded. Just drive past the building and park in the lots behind it. - Free wifi- Membership is kinda expensive, but it's worth it because I go several times a week and can't imagine life without it!", "date": "1/18/2016"}, {"review_id": "f8cUNyhmtOqhJxYbSGHIWQ", "user_id": "M2H9EyyADuJL74XUyz3Gow", "user_name": "May F.", "business_id": "8KZ0f0Do0Iq0tKcl4R3pmQ", "stars": 5, "useful": 0, "funny": 1, "cool": 1, "text": "As a recently graduate from grad school, I don't have the money to join yet.

I just found them to be over and beyond helpful and kind to us.A couple friends and I kept climbing and I love the very tall walls/ceilings and great natural light this gym has. A couple larger bouldering walls greet you in the entrance and then further back there are plenty of ropes for rock climbing and belaying. I hope to come back soon. The sign-in process was a bit of a drag as you have to fill out a lot of personal information and a waiver pre-climb. Probably not that much more than any other gym, but it would be great if they could someone speed that process up. The spot downtown is where the old Brewery used to be, parking is pretty reliable, but it would be better if there was a sign outside letting climbers know where the safe parking spots are.

My only issue with Sender is not a complaint really, but a sign they're doing stuff right. \u00a0It's a freaking zoo sometimes. \u00a0The route setting at Sender is superb, as is Stronghold, but Sender assigns ratings that are too soft IMO. \u00a0Most gym staffs by far will tell you that this is a marketing issue in that it encourages new climbers rather than discouraging them. \u00a0The concern here is that so many people are new to the sport and transitioning outside quickly without the long mentoring process of the past. \u00a0They are mistake prone and much more likely to get in a jam. \u00a0they climb hard in a gym and think it equates to outside. \u00a0Outside is DIFFERENT. \u00a0And DANGEROUS. \u00a0They often will have large groups at the crag--this isn't a good idea new folks. \u00a0Just don't do it. \u00a0It makes communication harder and monopolizes moderate routes.So, for Stronghold, Kudos! \u00a0Great staff too. \u00a0The crew on 3/26/16 was helpful, cool, professional, friendly.", "date": "3/27/2016"}, {"review_id": "_ttAkNo07IoWWRGWwZ8qEw", "user_id": "Xj0_OxzcfcQM6ZpiOg3KDA", "user_name": "Craig P.", "business_id": "8KZ0f0Do0Iq0tKcl4R3pmQ", "stars": 5, "useful": 7, "funny": 0, "cool": 3, "text": "WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW: the golden standard for climbing gyms. $20 for a day pass, $25 for pass and gear, $75 init. + $75/mo for membership with a guest pass once a month.

I used to be a member of Rockreation when I lived on the Westside, and have been to the LA.B, both in LA, but have also tried world class gyms in other cities. In general I find the gym acceptable and comfortable, and am content here. WHAT I LIKE: 1. They change their routes regularly and often... they have good route setters.2. Friendly staff3. Sufficient gym upstairs4. The music is never too offensive or obnoxious.5. Locker room has locks and plenty of lockers. 6. Plenty of parking.7. Members get to bring a guest for free each month.WHAT I WISH THEY WOULD CHANGE (in case management is reading): 1. Every gym I've been to has a family membership. They should too if they want to stay competitive. The second another nearby gym opens with family membership, I'll switch. Paying 2 initiation fees and individual fees/month for me and my husband? That is comparatively way more $$ than other gyms. 2. Their intro to climbing class is NOT UP TO PAR. I took it after taking Rockreation's so could directly compare. The owner spent 30 entire minutes talking about the history of climbing - which is not necessary for this type of class. He could have at least let us sit during that portion, but instead we stood the entire time and kept thinking it was about to be over. For brand new beginners who need to take a belay/intro class, the best use of time is making sure they know how to safely handle climbing equipment. \u00a0He needs an assistant. I repeatedly saw (and continue to when I am climbing) people in his intro class make really BAD, DANGEROUS MISTAKES. I sincerely feel he doesn't teach climbers how to belay properly considering the class is 3 hours. 3. It could definitely be cleaner. \u00a0All climbing gyms get covered in chalk, but I've been to gyms that are 30 years old, and if you don't attempt to clean it regularly, it gets worse and more disgusting.4.

Positives - Our instructor (Brian?) was wonderful! Gave great explanations (how and WHY to do things) and paid attention while we were learning to climb (so you always knew he'd be there if you were at the top and the belayer needed assistance with lowering you, etc). Also, his corrections given were really great and didn't leave you feeling stupid or incompetent. Overall, he was really enthusiastic about climbing and it made the class and evening enjoyable. The gym itself was very open and clean looking. Putting it inside an old brewery was really cool, with the exposed brick and vaulted ceilings! The information in the class was really informative without including excessive info. I've climbed before, but it helped refresh how to belay and reminded me how to tie into the harness, etc.They have locker rooms and showers (with lockers that don't need your own lock). The equipment seemed well maintained and effective.Offer a wide selection of nutrition bars and drinks so you can grab something if you forgot to eat before or get hungry during. The community in the gym seemed really positive and friendly. Most of the time we were paying attention to the class, but the couple climbs we did after class were easy to find a place to climb. Price - the price of the class was very reasonable, and it's great that they refund it if you become a member. Things to consider - (These may appear to be negatives, but actually just require a little bit of extra planning and don't detract from the five star review at all!) Parking - street parking, but it's in a sort of designated area for the gym. Seems like it could be pretty tricky, so plan to have to search a little for parking, rather than just pulling into a lot.No A/C - I assume this is because of the beautiful vaulted ceilings and not wanting to obstruct the view of the exposed brick. They do, however, have a LOT of fans throughout the gym. It really only seems concerning when you first walk in, but you get used to the temperature. I didn't find that this was a hindrance at all.

Noticed they were having a free showing of Reel Rock 9 tonight, thought it'd be a good time to check em out. Waiver process is fast and fluid, I brought all my own gear so I didn't need to check out anything. They make you become belay certified if you want to belay and lead certified if you want to lead, no problem. Matt was a great employee and led my belay certification and in a few minutes I was belaying my girlfriend and friend on other routes. Later I decided to do my lead certification, I've led many routes outdoors and am very comfortable sport climbing. I asked their employee Kate to help me, she was more than willing to help me out with any problem I had, and promptly looked for someone who could do the certification. She brought me Victor. Victor made me feel like he had better things to do and reminded me that they were closing soon and the fact that I wanted to do this now was unimportant to him. I led the route and came down. Victor said unfortunately he was going to have to fail me because my timing is bad and it was just a bad time for him, he told me he would pass me any other day but right now he just couldn't because he was busy. 1 minute later Victor is on a slack line taking photos, pretty busy huh Vic? I'll head else where to another gym, I gave this place an extra star due to the variety of climbs and Matt and Kate, they were very helpful.", "date": "11/9/2014"}, {"review_id": "YCqNrlY90spLzVorswXZmA", "user_id": "N1aRdDiHu_krLw6q9bMthA", "user_name": "Blake Z.", "business_id": "8KZ0f0Do0Iq0tKcl4R3pmQ", "stars": 5, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Super fun.

The entire gym is super clean, including the bathrooms, complete with lockers and showers. \u00a0 Now for the key part for me...... \u00a0the staff is very knowledgeable and very willing to help the newcomer and the folks that have been climbing awhile. I have gotten the cold shoulder at other gyms from staff including the owner of one of the local gyms. Not Here. Vic always greets me with a smile and he rocked my belay test giving me pointers that I didn't know and I've been climbing over 10 years. Great guy! The owners; Kate and Peter, are so helpful and super friendly too. They are very hands on with all the classes and everything that goes on in facility. Their passion for climbing and the sport is evident in the facility which is top notch. LA is lucky to have them. \u00a0 When it comes to indoor climbing.....

Amazing! \u00a0You can leave your kids as they say on the Web site but I would not recommend it as the instructors don't keep that close of an eye on each kid. \u00a0Sometimes the classes are super full and while their waiting for a rope the kids will go and climb the boulders but are also free to be able to just walk out and nobody would notice. \u00a0I bring my work or read while I'm there. \u00a0I think that I'm going to start working out with one of the trainers while my son is climbing. \u00a0This way we both get in a workout! \u00a0Amazing location and beautiful building!!", "date": "3/16/2015"}, {"review_id": "8phd-RNCjYKd8ddOgBBfAw", "user_id": "07e33hQfUnu1X7X91KT0Kw", "user_name": "John D.", "business_id": "8KZ0f0Do0Iq0tKcl4R3pmQ", "stars": 5, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "text": "The rock wall is gorgeous.

By terrible I mean they don't care about their members at all. It takes days for them to respond to an email (and you CAN'T get any service regarding your membership done at the front desk: only through emails) and they are definitely not flexible when it comes to pausing membership. If you have an emergency and can't use the gym, make sure to pause it at least 10 days ahead. I asked for an email 3 days before the first date of the month, was given the wrong email, waited for days, then emailed them again. By this point they charged my card. They don't even have the decency or courtesy to address my questions, just a template email. No explanation. Not even a \"regretfully we can't due to etc reason.\" They recently raised their already very high price to 10% more, yet no more service is being offered.
