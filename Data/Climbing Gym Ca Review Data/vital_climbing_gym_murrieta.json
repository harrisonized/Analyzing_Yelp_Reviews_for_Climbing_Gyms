The owner just installed two wooden finger boards and had the routes reset. The place is awesome, Bree and the rest of the staff are super-helpful (as well as knowledgeable) and they a great coffee bar. The idea is great, a 24 hour climbing gym on the honor system ( with a bunch if CC cameras to make sure you color within the lines). I your looking for Family Fitness, go join Family Fitness. If your looking for Cross-Fit, there are some great \u00a0 Cross-Fit gyms in the area; but if you want a great personable indoor bouldering gym at a reasonable price- VITAL is it !!!", "date": "2/1/2012"}, {"review_id": "YxVBuDHUJd7i1S8_hTdeBw", "user_id": "KkcqZbd4xa_1dQEkxstrlQ", "user_name": "George H.", "business_id": "DA91L5ZyppOG7-l4wQOSVw", "stars": 5, "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "This place is awesome! \u00a0A bouldering only gym, but that allows for it to be opened 24/7. \u00a0Long top out routes for all abilities and levels. \u00a0They have one of the best campus boards I have seen with 20 something rungs and the ability to adjust the angle. \u00a0Relaxing lounge area upstairs with free wifi ,drinks and snack for a dollar and even a communal ipad to play some tunes or surf the web. \u00a0Get some.", "date": "8/30/2011"}, {"review_id": "md0EHBkrnUkfZNJuprfTZA", "user_id": "8bHTHzVCh_gkDYgbgHK-8Q", "user_name": "Sean H.", "business_id": "DA91L5ZyppOG7-l4wQOSVw", "stars": 1, "useful": 4, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Only bouldering?

My youngest is short, but she scrambles up and down the wall and is gaining a great amount of strength and dexterity as a result. \u00a0The facility just reset half of the long wall so all those routes are new. \u00a0Sometimes it's also fun to just sit back, relax, and watch some of the better climbers, trying to pick up cues for techniques and strategy. \u00a0The clientele are generally friendly and the environment is family friendly (ignoring the occasional teens who sag and show their chones, at least my girls think they're idiots).", "date": "2/6/2012"}]
